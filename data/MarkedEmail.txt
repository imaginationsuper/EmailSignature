I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.



After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Lisa,



I'm the commercial person responsible for the sale of the Alberta PPA.  I was looking for an update on where this issue is at.



It is my understanding that we need to have the bankruptcy court bless ENA's shareholders resolution for the sale of the PPA.  Have we applied to the court to hear this matter?  What does the prospective timing look like?  I'm assuming that you are the individual responsible for coordinating this effort.



We are in a situation here where collateral demands ($23.7MM) have been made on Enron Canada Power Corp. which are due on Tuesday, December 18.  ECPC does not have the capacity to post this collateral.  It is my fear that the counterparty demanding the collateral will petition ECPC into court protection upon non-compliance with the collateral demand.



Additionally,  it is unclear how any court proceeding with Enron Canada Corp. may affect both ECPC and the PPA.  It is my understanding that there may be some activity on this front early next week.



Either one of these issues may cause a default under the PPA.  At that point in time the Owner of the PPA is free to terminate.  If the PPA is terminated, the value of this asset would go to zero.  It is clear that the Owner of the PPA is itching to terminate and this would terminate the proposed sale to Altagas Services of $215 MM.



Could you please get back to me with some guidance on this issue.

At the right time, it would be helpful to discuss what we may want to consider as Core Assets (unrelated to trading activities) for purposes of emerging from bankruptcy as a going concern.  As you know, we are in the process of organizing and formatting in an asset matrix the assets/businesses we currently own (or otherwise have an interest in) that may be potentially for sale; separating out potential core assets will be instructive as part of this process.



Please let me know your thoughts/suggestions over the next few weeks.

At Third Current Estimate, we added a full year forecast for MGT for Operations and added the MGT and Border amounts together on the Border page in the ETS Functional Income Statement as instructed.



We are trying to confirm what we should be reflecting.  Jason is being instructed that ETS should not pick up any actuals for January through May, and that we should use Actuals received from El Paso for June forward, and not our numbers.  The El Paso amounts for June through September are close to what we have, but not exact.



Please advise us as to what we should be reflecting and we will revise our schedules.  We did not pick up MGT at all until 3rd CE, so I'm OK with restating 3rd CE to reflect the appropriate amounts for MGT and rolling forward from there.

ISDA PRESS REPORT - DECEMBER 26, 2001



CREDIT DERIVATIVES

ISDA publishes credit survey - Risk



ENERGY

Enron's Success Story - The Wall Street Journal

 

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association released its first

survey of the global over-the-counter credit derivatives market last month,

showing a total notional outstanding volume of credit derivative

transactions of $631.5 billion as of the end of the first half of this year.

ISDA, which compiled information from 83 firms, hopes the survey will

provide a benchmark from which to chart future growth in the credit

derivatives market. This survey, and the others that have been done by Risk,

the British Bankers' Association (BBA), the US Office of the Comptroller of

the Currency (0CC) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) have all

used different methodologies on different samples, and have generated

varying results.



Risk's survey last year showed significantly higher total notional volumes

$810 billion. The BBA survey released in July 2000 also gave a higher

figure, forecasting $893 billion for the end of 2000. The BJS plans to

publish its triennial figures on the credit derivatives market later this

year.



Upward trend

According to ISDA, while still modest in relation to interest rate products,

the credit derivatives market is expected to remain on a strong upward trend

compared to more mature derivatives product areas. Most major dealers say

there has been a big increase in their credit derivatives volumes.  Mike

Brosnan, deputy comptroller of risk evaluation at the 0CC, pointed to a

challenge in assembling these surveys:

When you conduct a survey, some people may or may not respond, hence the

data could be incomplete. 



A problem with a survey is: who is the enforcer?' The OCC. which carries out

its own quarterly review of the US derivatives market, showed a decline in

the credit derivatives market, from $426 billion at the end of 2000 to $351

billion at the end of second-quarter 2001.

Brosnan attributes the decline in the credit derivatives market to

uncertainty among users, relating to restructuring issues sparked off by the

US life insurer Conseco's debt restructuring last year. However, according

to Tim Frost, head of JP Morgan's credit derivatives business in London, the

decline evidenced in the OCC's figures really comes down to a change in

reporting methods that occurred in 2000 from gross-to-net notional figures

on outstanding credit derivatives contracts. 





Enron's Success Story

The Wall Street Journal - December 26, 2001



The collapse of Enron was many things -- a gratifying slap in the face to

corporate hubris and an exposure of the Alfred E. Neuman club of stock

analysts, rating agencies and the SEC. It may even prove to be a fascinating

look into criminal minds. But there is one thing, for sure, it wasn't -- a

market failure. To the contrary, Enron's implosion was confirmation of the

principles that govern competitive markets.



Enron's success and failure ran along the lines set down in any

microeconomics text. The company discovered a new product -- mostly ways of

trading energy in the derivatives market -- that allowed producers and users

to lay off risk. This new product was wildly popular and, as the innovator,

Enron made lovely above-market returns. But those abnormal returns attracted

other firms into the business and Enron's advantage was gradually competed

away. Each new market entrant put the squeeze on Enron's margins.



What happened next is still a matter of speculation, but there are several

theories that seem reasonable.



Bad hedging. Although Enron started out as a plain vanilla energy company,

it shed those hard assets that could have underpinned its financial business

and morphed into a trading company and then, quickly, into a hedge fund. 



The Dismal Science

 

A trading company can make money no matter which direction the market goes

by simply trading and taking its money from creating a market. If prices are

falling, then suppliers rush into the market to get contracts that nail down

prices; if prices are rising, then users rush in to get contracts. Traders

can make money either way. Indeed, in this model, a volatile market is the

best of all possible worlds.



But with its margins -- and cash -- getting squeezed, Enron started

borrowing money and pretty soon it was running with remarkable leverage,

thus becoming a giant hedge fund. When things started to go wrong, Enron's

traders quite possibly were panicked into trying to hit a home run. That is,

they started taking big bets on the direction of the market, perhaps taking

aggressively long positions in energy. A successful hedge fund, however,

depends on adequately hedging bets, especially leveraged ones. But as Enron

started to lose money on its big bets, observers guess that the

insufficiency of its hedges began to look lethal.



There are also more complicated theories that argue Enron was hiding its

slowing growth in earnings with various accounting strategies.



Bad trading. Enron's main technique to pump up earnings probably revolved

around a loose-as-a-goose process for the accounting of energy derivatives.

Called mark-to-market, the technique involves evaluating contracts at fair

value prices. Since some of these contracts stretched out for 20 years, the

futures market provides no firm prices. And, absent a liquid market with

clear prices, fair value becomes a mug's game in which companies can

vastly inflate value. 



These overstated gains, of course, were also unrealized, noncash gains. In

September 2000, Jonathan Weil, a reporter for the Journal, took a look at

Enron's second quarter and found that absent noncash earnings, Enron would

have had a loss. Mr. Weil later found that for the year as a whole,

unrealized trading gains accounted for more than half of the company's

originally reported pretax profits. Hardly a confidence-builder in the

quality of Enron's earnings.



When their derivative strategies started to go sour, this theory runs, Enron

removed the contracts from its financial statements and hid them in special

entities created for just that purpose.



Bad Assets. Another theory locates Enron's earning problems in their hard

assets. Enron had a bunch of huge and underperforming assets, like its

broadband company, water company and power plants in India and Brazil. In

order to hustle those assets and associated debts off its financial reports,

the company created some limited partnerships to buy these dogs -- either

with bank loans or money provided by Enron itself. These partnerships

(allegedly) transferred enough control to third parties to get them off

Enron's balance sheet. 



Enron guaranteed these deals with make good provisions backed by Enron

stock -- a promise that Enron would make good any losses in the value of the

partnerships. When the value of the assets tanked, the make-good provisions

kicked in, resulting, for example, in the enormous write-down in shareholder

equity in November.



Depending on which theory one accepts, there are two bottom lines.



The first holds that the sagging earnings problem was fatal and that it is

entirely possible Enron was in the process of liquidating itself. Jim Chanos

of Kynikos Associates hypothesizes that Enron's cost of capital was higher

than its returns on invested capital. A second argues that if Enron's

managers had been content to accept the fact that in competitive markets

their first mover advantage was going to be competed away, and had been

willing to endure slower earnings growth, it would not be in bankruptcy

today.



Enron's collapse also says something valuable about the energy trading

markets: Competitive markets worked just as expected. As questions were

raised about the quality of Enron's earnings -- and, just as important, not

answered -- investors grew wary. Although the stock opened the year trading

in the 80s, it started drifting down as investors bailed. The stock had

already lost half its value and was trading below 40 before the company

announced a big third-quarter loss and made its first disclosure of

accounting mistakes in October.



At the same time, traders outside the company had begun to unwind positions

and do business with other firms. At the end of September, Enron had 25% of

the energy-trading market. Just two months later, its business had

disappeared but that disappearance didn't cause the tiniest ripple in the

market. The swift collapse of what once was a $77 billion dollar company

failed to generate either a price spike or a supply interruption because the

market was sufficiently liquid and deep to absorb it.



In short, no matter how one views the purposes or operations of a

competitive market, the history of Enron proves that the market works pretty

much as expected. And thus the story of Enron is, so far, a success story.

A spanner in the works 

Risk - December 2001



When the Basel Committee issued its second consultative document proposals

(CP2) for a new regulatory capital Accord in January, it prompted fierce

opposition from banks, academics and lobbying groups over its treatment of

loans to small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This sector is the

backbone and growth engine of many major economies. Now, nearly a year

later, the issue has come to a head. The US and Germany - which is fiercely

protective of its SME sector, the mittelstand - are engaged in brinkmanship

over the capital treatment of loans to SMEs that could cause the entire

Basel II capital Accord to unravel.



SME lenders' initial concerns included the steepness of Basel's credit risk

weighting curve for the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, its

insistence that expected loss provisions should be made in addition to

typical unexpected loss provisions, confusion over which SME loans could be

included under the retail approach, and the extent to which physical

collateral could be used as a risk mitigant. The Committee has moved to

address many of these concerns, although some, like the risk weighting

curve, remain prickly. But a critical issue, the use of maturity adjustments

in the calculation of capital charges for corporate and SME lending, which

requires banks to put aside more capital for longer-dated loans, is far from

being settled.



The German banking industry in particular is worried that overly harsh SME

treatment would push up lending costs, thereby stifling capital to a vital

source of the country's economic growth. While German banks have several

concerns, the country's lack of flexibility on the maturity issue threatens

to derail the entire Basel II process, which in turn would throw the

European Directive based on Basel II into disarray.



While most Basel lobbying has been carried out via traditional banking

channels - with national banking associations petitioning their regulators

that sit on the Basel Committee and its working groups - the debate in

Germany, Europe's largest economy, involves the highest levels of

government. German chancellor Gerhard Schr?der and economics minister Werner

M?ller said in late October that German funding to the mittelstand must not

be impaired by Basel II. Basel II is not acceptable to Germany in its

present form. Everyone must reckon with our opposition to a European Union

guideline based on Basel II, said Schr?der, referring specifically to

treatment of SMEs.



The Basel Committee has since issued a paper, 'Potential modifications to

the Committee's proposals', which outlines current thinking within the

Committee and indicates that it will make key concessions to SME lenders.



The most important aspect of the paper, released November 5, is the

Committee's move to lower and flatten the IRB risk weighting capital curve -

which is a function of a firm's probability of default. This significantly

lowers capital requirements for SME lending. The move is based on evidence

that small companies are less likely than large corporates to default during

economic downturns.



But the paper failed to touch on the maturity debate. [It] says nothing

about maturity, just about the risk weights without any maturity

adjustments, says Tobias Winkler, head of international banking issues in

the department for banking supervision at the Bundesverband deutscher Banken

(Association of German Commercial Banks). This a right step, but certain

additional things have to be done to take account of special circumstances

of SME lending [in Germany], he adds. The maturity adjustment has to be

abolished in the advanced approach, he argues.



The German side claims the terms of loans to the mittelstand are

significantly longer than those to their SME counterparts in the US or the

UK.



We have got very long maturities, this would put German banks at an

enormous competitive disadvantage compared with other countries, says

Winkler.



Evidence to support this argument is hard to come by, especially since the

Basel Committee refuses to disclose cross-country comparisons for factors

like average loan maturities from its second quantitative impact study (QIS

2). But several officials with access to QIS 2 data say the average maturity

of loans made by domestic financial institutions to businesses in Germany is

4.28 years, a figure that falls to 2.95 years for Germany's internationally

active banks. Average maturities for business loans in other G-10 countries

were said to lie between two and 2.5 years. 



The CP2 proposals for Basel II contained two maturity approaches in IRB

treatment, one called the 'default model', ironically said to be a German

proposal, and the other a US 'mark-to-market' approach strongly backed by

the British. Under these two approaches, it is assumed that the risk of

default on a loan is higher if it is longer-dated, an assertion that has

been supported by several studies of historic data. The 'mark-to-market'

approach also takes into account the economic deterioration of the position

and not just final default. This Anglo model heavily penalises longer-term

loans. According to the Zentraler Kreditausschus (ZKA), a central banking

association which represents the interests of German commercial banks,

savings banks, regional state banks and co-operatives, long-term exposures

of seven years could require up to six times as much capital as one year

exposures - although one German banking official said a cap had now been

placed on maturities at five years, reducing this figure to 400%. Capital

add-ons for long-term loans would therefore seriously affect the

international competitiveness of the German banking industry and result in

higher interest rates for borrowers that would not be justified by the risk

exposure, said the ZKA in a statement during the comment period.



But Germany stands virtually alone in its refusal to accept the US-led

maturity proposals. The data analysed by the Committee clearly shows that

you have these upward-sloping curves for maturities. What kills a bank is

deterioration of value, and it has got to provide for a lot of things on the

books, so you can't wait for final default, said a Basel Committee member.

But you can argue about the steepness, and that is a matter for debate.

The fact that Germany's other key allies in the wider SME debate - namely

Japan, Italy and Spain - are in favour of maturity adjustments, has prompted

a number of non-German regulators, albeit veiled behind the protection of

anonymity, to play down the importance of the maturity impasse to Basel II's

implementation. But such views fail to take into account the depth of

feeling that German banks, banking associations, the Bundesbank, parliament

and the general public have in protecting funding to the mittlestand. This

unusual level of pressure has left the German negotiators with very little

room for manoeuvre.



Gerhard Hofmann, director of banking supervision at the Deutsche Bundesbank,

was one of the few regulators prepared to speak publicly on the issue. He

said his hands were all but tied on the maturity debate, and confirmed that

the German side would be prepared to scupper Basel II's timetable should a

deal fail to be reached. If this does not come to an end, then the European

effort will be postponed too. I have difficulties imagining that we would

introduce Basel II in Europe and not have a level playing field on a G-10

basis. While Hofmann said the matter was very serious, he remained

confident that all sides could reach a solution.

 

Compromise

Risk was told by one European banking representative who claims to be

closely involved in the talks that a current compromise suggestion is to

halve the US mark-to-market maturity adjustments. This would mean the 600%

figure mentioned in the ZKA paper for a 'AAA'-rated, seven-year loan would

be reduced to 200%. But a US representative distanced himself from this

being a US proposal. I would not describe the negotiating position that

way, he said. Asked if the US team would agree such a concession, he added,

I couldn't say that we would, but it would depend on the whole package.

Fifty per cent on the mark-to-market adjustment seems an obvious point to

try and compromise on, but I'm not sure the US side would agree to that.



Hofmann was also cautious, saying I would rather hesitate to comment on

that, but yes, it is a direction we are heading. This is a critical point

and I hesitate to comment in public because we are in the midst of this

rather difficult negotiating process and I really don't want to jeopardise

anything. It will be quite tough.  While almost every country that supports

maturity adjustments believes a 50% mark-down would be an acceptable

compromise, Germany may still hold out. Another German bank executive says

it may find a 50% mark-down unsatisfactory.



Another area of potential compromise is to allow banks with loan maturities

of less than three years to gain a downward capital allocation adjustment,

while banks with loans of more than three years would be capped at the

three-year level - as factored into the current proposed standardised credit

approach. 



But German bankers appear set to resist even this level of compromise,

claiming that German internationally active banks (with average maturities

of 2.95 years) would be on an unfair playing field with other

internationally active banks, which have average maturities closer to the

two years. But German banking officials could not come up with hard data to

support the claims.



While maturity is the largest single SME-related issue for the Basel

Committee to resolve, there are a number of other matters that also need

clearing up, and, once again, the Germans are digging in their heels. For

example, the IRB credit risk-weighting curve proposed by the Committee on

November 5 fails to completely assuage concern about higher SME lending

charges. While Basel's current approach would mean that banks would have to

set aside significantly less capital against SMEs, which typically fall in

the 1% to 3% probability of default range, compared with CP2 proposals,

charges are still higher than under the present rules. For example, a bank

lending to an SME with a 2% probability of default would now have to set

aside 10.3% of the capital, compared with 15.4% under the January proposals.



Collateral mitigation could reduce this to 9.3%, and receivables mitigation

might further reduce the amount to 8.3%.



But Hofmann believes this risk-weighting curve does not go far enough. When

you look at the curve, the typical probability of default range for an SME,

which is around 2%, still triggers a capital charge of above 10% - 2

percentage points above the current treatment, he says. This will translate

into the pricing of these loans. How big will the interest rate effect be

on SMEs? According to our calculations it is still significant, Hofmann

says.



As a result, the Bank of Italy and the Deutsche Bundesbank drafted a

confidential joint paper, released October 19, which was submitted to the

Committee's working group on overall capital. The paper proposes that a

function based on the relationship between asset correlation and size should

be added to the IRB risk-weight curve methodology based on the relationship

between asset correlation and probability of default. The paper,

'Calibration of benchmark risk weights in the IRB approach to regulatory

capital requirements', contends that joint treatment of probability of

default and a firm-size effects on asset correlation could produce a risk

weighting function that addresses both procyclicality issues produced by the

new framework and concerns related to the treatment of lending to SMEs. The

Committee is now investigating the matter as part of an additional

quantitative impact study, QIS 2.5.



But many banks, including German financial institutions, are strongly

opposed to the introduction of additional parameters, such as number of

employees, assets and turnover functions into the risk-weighting curve. They

see a size function as an unnecessary complication. Segmentation on the

grounds of turnover is unsatisfactory to us. Retail businesses and wholesale

businesses may have similar turnover, but the characteristics and the way

you would manage them in risk terms would be quite different, says Colin

Jennings, senior manager, non-retail related risk at Lloyds TSB, the UK's

third largest bank. If that was imposed on us we would have to change our

systems considerably to do what we think would achieve no real benefit,

adds Simon Baker, Lloyds TSB's head of risk policy, overseeing about ?6

billion in commercial portfolios (above ?2 million in turnover) and an equal

amount in small business portfolios, plus retail loans to its 16 million

retail customers base.



Further effects

Bankers are also opposed to another key aspect of Basel II that affects SME

lending. The Committee believes banks should put aside capital for expected

losses in addition to the current practice of making capital charges against

unexpected losses - credit risk. From a theoretical view of capital, such

requirements should be fulfilled by future margin income and not by

regulatory capital allocations. The Germans favour this 'pure' approach.



Expected losses are covered by future margin income. We don't need any

double counting by using regulatory capital to cover expected losses, says

a German banker.



Although Basel has made some concessions in this area, saying it would scrap

expected loss provisions for retail loans - excluding mortgages - and allow

deductions from special and general loan loss reserves against expected

losses, the Committee's 'inelegant solution' has again run into German

opposition. The German Ministry of Finance restricts the amount of

loan-loss reserves due to fears that banks would attempt to reduce their

income figures to avoid tax payments, says one German banker. We fear that

this could lead to a severe international competitive disadvantage for

German banks because of tax regulations, so we are very much against

covering expected losses with regulatory capital.



A potential solution is to include expected losses under Pillar II of Basel

II, leaving it up to the discretion of national supervisors to ensure

expected losses are fully covered, while ensuring a level playing field

among nations. But some claim the Committee is unconvinced that expected

losses are fully accounted for by national regulators in specific product

areas or nations like Japan, and have pushed for specific Pillar I treatment

to alleviate their concerns. The current envisioned compromise is that this

will not be done across the board. While it is not an elegant solution, it

addresses the most important substantive concerns the industry has raised

about the inclusion of expected loss, says a Basel Committee member.



The strong German opposition to so many SME-related treatments will make a

speedy resolution difficult, with much said to be hinging on sideline

discussions between the German and American contingents ahead of the Capital

Task Force and Basel Committee meetings, scheduled for December 6 and 7 in

New York, and the December 12 and 13 in Basel, respectively. With the timing

tight in terms of enshrining a European Directive in European Union and

European national legislation, the industry needs a major breakthrough based

on sound banking supervision practices, rather than an appeasement in

response to political sabre-rattling, which risks weighing down the entire

Basel II process.



ISDA and FpML.org to merge

Risk - December 2001

By Rob Dwyer

 

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association plans to integrate

FpML.org the not-for-profit company set up to develop Financial products

Markup Language (FpML) - into its organisational structure by the end of the

year. The merger of the two organisations is aimed at facilitating the

development of FpML by allowing FpML.orgs members to concentrate on

technical issues.



Mart Meinel, co-chair of FpML's standards committee and head of fixed-income

IT at UBS Warburg, says becoming part of ISDA will remove the burden of

administration from the technical team. We will be able to use ISDA

resources which will speed up the implementation of version 2.0 and the

development of version 3.0,' he says. 'The standards committee ended up

doing a lot of the administration work to run the FpML symposiums, and we

hope to leverage off ISDA conferences (for future symposiums).



FpML based on the flexible extensible markup language' (XML), is designed to

create an industry standard for electronic trading. FpML 1.0, launched in

July 2000, covers interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.  FpML is

presently working on version 2.0, which will include swaptions, caps,

floors, collars and straddles, as well as several other instruments, as well

as those covered in 1.0.  Implementation is slated for the end of December.

The committee is also planning to publish a draft of 3.0, which will extend

FpML coverage to foreign exchange and equity derivatives, by the end of this

year.



Meinel says FpML's integration with ISDA was part of the standards

committee's strategy from the organisation's inception. 'Since we have been

working on ISDA documentation then converting that into XML, our work has a

natural fit with ISDA, says Meinel, Operating from inside ISDA will help

the development of FpML be better aligned with the documentation of new

products as it comes along.



Strain

Robert Pickel, ISDA's chief executive officer, says the merger will allow

members of FpML to focus on technical development. But will it prove a

strain on often-stretched ISDA resources? We envision adding some extra

staff, and we project that we will be able to find the extra funding needed

through due-based revenues' says Pickel. As a volunteer organization, it

was an issue for FpML members to find time aside from their day jobs. And

yet they have still managed to establish FpML as a brand that is the basis

for OTC derivatives transactions in the future, he adds.



FpML users welcomed the announcement.  Mark Brickell, chief executive

officer of online swaps trading platform Blackbird, and chairman of lSDA

between 1988 and 1992, says: We actively encouraged ISDA to take on this

project.  Creating FpML is as important as the ISDA Master Swap Agreement,

because it will strengthen the framework for the swap negotiation.

Brickell says Blackbird was the first company to offer FpML confirmations to

its customers, and he believes ISDA will accelerate the adoption of 2.0 and

expand FpML further to cover more kinds of transactions more quickly.



Observers say the success of the project depends on recruiting. An official

at an FpML-affiliated company says: ISDA hasn't had this level of

technology project before, so the key will he whether it hires someone with

the requisite level of technological expertise. ISDA officials say details

about FpML recruitment have yet to be finalised.

Property tax liability, in a given tax year i.e. 2002, is directly related to the level of income and asset cost of the prior calendar year i.e. 2001.  As in the case of NNG & TW, income and asset cost are increasing. Therefore, property taxes also will increase.



In order to keep the property tax liability flat, three strategies are available (1) book any gain on the sale of an asset below the line (N.U.O.I.), (2) assets there are no longer in service should be retired from the books of records, and (3) items that can be expensed should be expensed and not capitalized to plant, property, & equipment.

US Fed, Treasury, SEC, CFTC Survey Recommends No New Swaps Law

Dow Jones - December 28, 2001

By Rebecca Christie



WASHINGTON -- U.S. financial market regulators recommended no new

legislation to regulate swap agreements involving customers with low net

worth, according to a study released Thursday by four federal agencies.



The U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Commodity Futures Trading

Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a joint report

on retail swaps Thursday assessing whether there was a need for further

regulation.



A swap is a type of financial transaction in which two parties agree to

exchange payments or securities over a period of time. Swaps contracts are

generally used by large institutions to hedge risk, such as interest-rate

risk or currency risk.



Retail swaps involve customers who are not eligible contract participants

under federal law. This group includes individuals who have less than $10

million in assets, or less than $5 million under certain conditions, as well

as non-financial entities that have total assets of less than $10 million

and do not use swaps as a normal part of their business.



Retail swaps are not covered under recent legislation that regulates

derivatives. The study released Thursday surveyed representatives from

dealers, a derivatives trading system and a trade association.



The joint report said that the four agencies do not currently see a need to

regulate most swaps involving these small customers, with the possible

exception of energy swaps. Should regulators see a need to oversee energy

swaps, current legislation appears to give the CFTC some latitude to act,

the report said.



If interest in energy swaps were to outpace the current scope of the CFTC's

authority, Congress might wish to step in at that time, the report said.



2001: A Derivatives Odyssey

FOW - December 2001



The derivatives industry in 2001 has experienced continued consolidation

among users and exchanges. Electronic trading practices have further

penetrated into traditional procedures, while exchanges have reaped healthy

revenues from derivative contracts.



One product that has swept across the world's derivatives exchanges this

year is the single stock future. London International Financial Futures and

Options Exchange (Liffe) launched its Universal Stock Futures in January

2001, to great fanfare but only moderate success. Nevertheless, exchanges in

Europe and Asia rushed to jump on the single stock bandwagon. Anxious not to

miss out on the action, the US repealed the Shad-Johnson accord, in place

since 1982, which prevented investors betting on the future price of

individual stocks. The repeal was set to become effective on 21 December,

but has since been postponed to the end of March 2002. Bill Rainer, who was

chairman of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) at the

time of the repeal, notes that while the bill is generally sound, it is

still within the period of industry comment.



Rainer has since moved on and is currently heading one of the newest single

stock ventures, between Chicago Board of Trade (CBoT), Chicago Mercantile

Exchange (CME) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). This remarkable

alliance pools the resources and liquidity of the three exchanges, giving

serious competition to American Stock Exchange (Amex) and the joint offering

between Liffe and Nasdaq. While the single stock futures will be offered to

alt qualified market participants, Rainer feels the product will not be

suited to all sectors of the market. They are likely to be more attractive

to the institutional sector than the individual sector because institutions

have the resources to educate themselves about the value of the product and

its place in their strategies, he explains. Nevertheless, he is confident

in the product's value as a useful risk management tool for any

practitioner. However, confidence in single stocks is far from unanimous.

Not withstanding the hype, dissenters note that the volumes in single stocks

are subdued around the world. The start of trading in the US may give them a

much-needed boost but, as yet, the money is going elsewhere.



The evolution of the index derivative product business has been the most

significant development in 2001, says Uwe Velten, at European derivatives

exchange, Eurex, and he thinks it will continue. This is just the beginning

of a strong product group. Index products are one of the most intelligent

tools to manage risk with, he assures. As they are a trend in the market,

we encourage them in our portfolio. Velten notes that the importance of

index products has increased with their expanding geographical scope. For

years, futures and options on the Dax was our only index product. Then we

expanded our product offering beyond national products. ParisBourse, Swiss

Exchange, Deutsche Bourse and Dow Jones created Stoxx in early 1998 to

provide a European-wide family of indices. When Eurex was created, we

captured all euro Stoxx business, and today we average around 220,000

contracts a day, and this is growing,



Velten explains. Now we have moved into global offerings, with Nymex 50

futures and options and sector index products from Dow Jones, which are

growing from a small base. This is what the future will bring. The business

is growing in Europe with sector index products and, globally, with the new

Global Titans products. Eurex has experienced 80% growth in index products

this year, compared with 250/0 growth in capital market products and the

fixed income sector, and 500/0 growth in stock options.  Eurex's five-year

German government bond (Bobl) contract was the fixed-income headline grabber

of 2001. When one market player successfully manufactured a bobl squeeze in

March by cornering the market in the physically deliverable futures

contracts, Eurex needed to act fast to avoid a repeat performance in

September. In an overhaul of its securities regulations, the exchange

introduced position limits on the futures contracts and, crucially,

rectified the discrepancy in penalty charges for the late delivery of

underlying securities with drastic cuts. The fixed income community offered

only timid approval however, and few believed a squeeze could be fully

avoided.



Sensing opportunity in the air Euronext Paris re-launched its five-year

European government bond futures contact in a bid to capture market share

from disenchanted Bobl traders. A deal between Eurex and the German finance

agency Bundesfinanz Agentur finally stretched the September Bobl, with an

agreement to supply additional bonds in case of another shortage. By

extending the pool of deliverable securities the Bobl looks set for an easy

ride this December. However, the long-term future of government debt markets

in general still hangs in the balance.



Both sides of the Atlantic have suffered a dearth of government bonds amid

treasury buy-back programmes and cuts in issuance this year. Most recently,

the US Treasury stopped issuing 30-year bonds in November. Subsequently,

investors have begun to favour the swaps market to hedge their interest rate

risk. Many market sources and the Bank for International Settlements claim

that interest rate swaps are the leading candidate to replace government

securities as the leading capital market's benchmark. In March, as the

fragmented government bond market continued to shrink amid high-profile

contract squeezes, Liffe entered the fray, hoping to mop up business with a

family of euro-denominated futures on interest rate swaps, collectively

named Swapnote. Contrary to the many doubts over the product's ability to

capture liquidity from the OTC market, it attracted substantial interest.

The success of the contract in Europe convinced Liffe to make plans for

expansion into the US market with the euro-denominated swap futures, with

speculation of a US dollar swap contract to follow.



Witnessing the success of Swapnote, and conscious of its faltering T-bond

future, CBoT introduced a suite of swaps derivatives that made a promising

debut in November. Nicholas Neubauer, chairman at CBoT, explains the

concerns underlying the decision. Earlier this year, there was a feeling

that the amount of publicly available Federal debt would decline to zero

over the next five to ten years. We, therefore, wanted to offer our

customers a swap contract as an alternative tool. While these new swap

contracts have proved highly popular, they must be seen in perspective - for

example, while Liffe's daily average for Swapnote is around 20,000

contracts, Eurex's ten-year bond averages nearer 500,000. Nevertheless, it

is a product class with great potential. As Neubauer says: If it is going

to be a winner, it will be a big winner.



Volumes in the options market have been thriving in 2001. A single day

record of 2.7m was notched by CBOE in April, which is now in competition

with five other options exchanges in the US. We are very pleased with this

year's performance, especially in light of the increased competition, both

domestically and internationally, says Edward Provost, executive vp at

CBOE. However, all has not been plain sailing, and the options market has

suffered upheaval with the move to decimalisation. In the case of options,

this change required a substantial technological effort to trade decimals

instead of fractions, comments Provost. It also has a significant impact

on the way options traders operate, even more than on the stock side. The

move to modernity was sanctioned because a stock price quoted in fractions

forces an artificially wide spread. But while decimalisation allows for many

more potential price points for a stock, it subsequently creates an

amplification of complexity for options pricing. This increased capacity

for market quotation results in an increased number of market floatation

updates, explains Provost. So it was all about operational preparedness,

and adapting systems for a surge in business. For CBOE, the change to

decimals went very smoothly.



Electronic trading

Technological upheaval has affected many derivatives exchanges in 2001 and

the troubles at CBoT have been symptomatic of the industry as a whole. By

the end of 2000 there was a great deal of doom and gloom on the trading

floor about the impact of electronic trading, says Nicholas Neubauer. Our

business model of open-outcry trading was being slated for early extinction

in favour of electronic matching engines. On top of this, he explains,

plans to become a for-profit organisation were seen as simplistic and caused

two lawsuits with the CBOE. In addition, the ceo of 20 years left. Having

set forth a programme of ten promises, including modifying the restructuring

plan, hiring a high quality ceo, and settling the law suits, Neubauer has

now put the exchange back on track.



Meanwhile, Ace, the electronic trading joint venture between CBoT and Eurex,

has been the subject of much wrangling over maintenance responsibilities.

However, the platform averages around 20,000 contracts a day, accounting for

roughly 230/0 of business. Generally we have found that, on volatile days,

people use open-outcry and, on slow days, Ace increases its market share,

explains Neubauer. During volatile periods, traders get more information

out of a central marketplace than the more sterile environment of screen

trading. After the heartache that electronic trading and Ace in particular

caused, it was Ace's performance that fuelled the exchange's return to

profit in September.  Teething problems with new electronic trading systems

have been rife among many derivatives exchanges this year. As CBoT and Eurex

feuded over Ace, London Metal Exchange saw a lacklustre response to Select,

picking up slightly after a phase two launch in October, and New York

Mercantile Exchange argued with the providers of Enymex.



However, Liffe's Connect system has been the key to the revival of its

fortunes. After a few false starts, Connect has quickly gained acclaim for

its superior matching and distribution capabilities. Liffe won its first

major deal with Nasdaq to list futures on single stocks on Connect. Then, in

July, Liffe agreed to provide Connect products and services to Tokyo

Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Tiffe). In an alliance similar to

Ace, the Connect link allows Tiffe and Liffe members to trade on one

another's exchanges. It was Liffe's aptitude with derivative technology that

placed the company on a firm footing for November's merger. 



In October, CBOE launched CBOEdirect, to a modest reception. The system will

operate in pre-trade hours, initially with options on the Dow Jones

Industrial Index. CBOE's Provost explains that a feature of the system is

underscoring the world's altered preoccupations. One benefit of beginning

to use screen-based trading is that it is a very logical and viable disaster

recovery trading system. This is something we, and other exchanges, are

looking at.



Of course, any retrospective on 2001 would not be complete without mention

of the World Trade Centre tragedy. During this terrible time, the financial

community came together with firm resolve, to help colleagues and

competitors alike, in an unprecedented show of solidarity. There was a

defiant determination to keep financial markets functioning as close to

normality as possible throughout the terrible ordeal, and in memory of those

who died.

Furnas: Nothing particularly new to report since last week, other than it appears we are likely to get the consent documents signed Tuesday or Wednesday. These documents reflect a resolution to the consent issue and the Resolution 49 regulatory issues that changed some of the risks under the PPA.   As reported last week, one of the reasons Furnas/Electrobras have agreed to sign is because the two difficult issues regarding (i) the validity of the Electrobras guaranty following privatization; and (ii) political force majeure allowing a put option for Brazilian governmental acts, were deleted from the Furnas consent documents and will be negotiated separately with the Brazilian government over the next two weeks.  These issues must also be resolved for financing.  



GT11/12:  Repairs still on schedule to meet requirements under the PPA for the changeover to gas by year end.  Siemens and our engineers will meet with the underwriters in London tomorrow to discuss the root cause of the failures.  Still no written confirmation of coverage, but we currently do not anticipate a problem.



Shell:  Preparing for mediation to be held in Toronto November 5-7.



ANNEX V



After reporting last week that the cost pass through suits had been filed, I learned that Orlando Gonzales made the commercial decision to hold off on those suits because of significant progress he made in negotiations with the Brazilian government for resolution of these issues and Annex V.



Elektro received some of the information from ASMAE for calculating its numbers; however, as of Friday it had not received the information for the rationing period, the relevant period for calculating the set off.  I talked with Vasco this morning and he believed this information was received today and will confirm.  If the information is not forthcoming, we are prepared to file a suit to compel it.  



I will stay in touch with Orlando this week to determine if and when we can file these suits without interfering with his negotiations.

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.



We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.



The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.



This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.



I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.



Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Good Morning,



I pray that all is well with you this morning. I wanted to share a

prophetic word with you on this morning that went forth after our Building

Fund committee meeting last night. (As shared with me by our First Lady,

Edith Wallace).



Bro Andrew shared a word that we as a people are to follow our Moses that

God has given us and that God is calling all things to order. He stated

that when the Pastor speaks and gives a word of instructions, we are to

listen and stop bickering amongst ourselves like the children of Israel and

follow the man of God.



He, Bro Andrew stated that God said that if we as a church would unite and

pray for the Pastor and his wife for the next 21 days at 3:00 and everyone

be on one accord, God said that He would move mightily.



This will be shared in an announcement on Sunday to let the

church know, this would be in line of things and that the church needs to

get to a point of obedience, because one of the reason why the church has

gone around the mountain is because things have been out of order.



God is an awesome God and we want to give Him thanks for what He doing.

Please forward this information to as many people with contact information

before Sunday. Because this is something that we as a people can begin

doing today and share the Word with the congregation on Sunday.

Attached is a revised version of the CA with Goldman.  The remaining issue is in Section 1 regarding restrictions on Goldman's use of the Confidential Information.  Goldman believes that they will have to bring a lot of their personnel, including traders, over the wall in order to perform this engagement, and that such personnel will by necessity see some of our Confidential Information.  While they agree that their personnel shouldn't be able to use our specific information against us in future transactions, they are worried that the restriction on their use of our info that is set out in Section 1 could limit the future activities of those folks simply because they saw some of our Confidential Information and are carrying it around in their heads, and at any time could be accused of using our info.

 

Initially, Goldman insisted on removing the restriction on use. We have suggested the language at the end of Section , which would generally restrict use of the information to the engagement, but would allow Goldman's non-IB's to work on the deal but perform their other jobs without worrying about violating the CA as long as they weren't using the notes that they took while they were in our shop.  Admittedly, it is not as clean as I would like, but I think this adequately addresses both parties' concerns.

 

Goldman was initially receptive to this language, and will call tomorrow morning with any other comments.

Dividend uncertainty enhances option pricing risk - Risk News



German power exchanges to merge

Financial Times - October 26, 2001

By Bettina Wassener 



Germany's two electricity exchanges, the European Energy Exchange and the

Leipzig Power Exchange, confirmed on Friday that they will merge by the

start of next year in a move that will pool liquidity in Europe's biggest

power trading market. 



The rival exchanges said on Friday the move was a merger of equals, though

existing shareholders in the Frankfurt-based EEX, whose owners include the

Eurex derivatives market, will hold 57.5 per cent of the merged exchange. 



Both exchanges were started fairly recently to capitalise on the boom in

power trading after liberalisation in the electricity sector since the late

1990s, but have faced competition from bilateral trades, and jointly

represent only 6.6 per cent of the market. 



The LPX, backed by power exchange Nord Pool, launched Germany's first spot

bourse in June last year, just ahead of a similar move by its

Frankfurt-based rival. The EEX began trading electricity futures earlier

this year. 



Due to the merger, the LPX will not now go ahead with plans to launch its

own futures contract which had been expected this year. The merged exchange

will offer a combination of the existing trading systems. 



The new exchange, to be called EEX but based in Leipzig, will be run jointly

by Hans Schweickhardt, EEX's chief executive, and Carlhans Uhle, his

counterpart at the LPX. About 90 participants from nine countries will trade

at the new EEX. 





Dividend uncertainty enhances option pricing risk

Risk News - October 24, 2001

By Sarfraz Thind



The growing spate of dividend cuts in the global markets has made dividends

a potential source of uncertainty in the pricing of equity derivatives.

Companies across the board now have reduced expectations of meeting their

earnings forecasts following the downturn in the economy, which, combined

with increasing use of share buybacks and return of capital as alternative

methods of cash distribution, has placed pressure on dividends, bankers said

Michael Maras, Merrill Lynch 



The latest analysis on European equity derivative markets by Merrill Lynch

forecasts a 2.52% decline in the dividend payments of FTSE 100 constituents

for 2001. Merrill's report said that market expectations for earnings and

dividend growth remain excessively optimistic. It added that earnings and

dividend forecasts across Europe are increasingly likely to see a downward

adjustment over the next six months, with dividend growth in the Euro Stoxx

50 index declining by around 2.5%. 



Michael Maras, global equity derivatives director at Merrill Lynch, told

RiskNews that the report was intended to warn investors of potential

dividend cuts, so that they re-evaluate their dividend yield ratios. Maras

pointed to companies such as the UK's Rolls Royce and Dutch bank ABN Amro

that have already had their dividend payment ability cast under doubt. He

identified the auto, technology and financial sectors as being especially

vulnerable. 



A lot more trading houses will be reducing dividend expectations. This is a

global phenomenon, though it's a lot more intense in Europe, as [European]

companies have an over-reliance on dividends. 



An equity derivatives trader at Morgan Stanley, who asked not to be named,

said that Merrill Lynch was absolutely right. We are very, very cautious

about how we price options going through the dividend period.

Hi:



I heard back that many of you have been unable to open the original

solicitation letter I sent to you because of the links involved with the

mail merge.  So, I removed the links and am resending it to you in hopes

that it works this time.  I have gotten requests from many of you to resend

letters via fax, etc. to various businesses.  I am more than happy to do

that for you.  Unless you tell me otherwise, in the interest of time, I am

signing your names to those letters and faxing them.  However, if you want

to use the attached letter on your own, feel free.



#sig#Thanks,

This is just an example of how Enron got affected by ANEEL's decision to lower the spot price from R$684/MWh to R$336/MWh.  This Eucatex deal involved both a fixed payment and a variable payment (the latter based on a % of the spot price).

Hello everyone.  I know that many, if not all of you, have worked on numerous requests/initiatives from the office of the chair and other teams lately.  That being said, we received a new request on Thursday night which is another look at some of the information your groups may have already provided, along with some other information.  Attached is a file, with the breakouts and formats as requested by management, containing four (for some of you, five) spreadsheets.  Please complete all of these sheets applicable to your business unit (note: dollars in millions).   The requested timing of the completion of this exercise is by 3pm Friday, November 15.  Please send the completed file back to me as soon as you are finished.  If you have any questions about the format or the contents of the file, please contact Michelle Nezi Marvin at 3-6848. For any other questions, please call Mark Lindsey at 3-1873.

I just wanted to close the loop on the question of deferring the $.7million UCU credit to 2002.  The last we talked, it was decided that we could not defer the credit because of cash target concerns.  If this is still the directive, we will see a positive variance to Third Current Estimate in October of $1.2 million.  



Would you confirm that this is still our decision?  If so, we will include the earnings upside  in our Quarter Forecast next week.



#sig#Thanks
Hello Everyone,

I look forward to meeting everyone on Tuesday.

Performance-Based Ratemaking Conference



December 5-7, 2001, Denver, CO



OVERVIEW



 



Performance Based Ratemaking (PBR) is emerging as a key element of the restructuring of the electric utility industry. For PBR to be effective it must be designed carefully and uniquely for each utility so as to align the interests of the utility, the shareholders and the customers and also to make sure that PBR is successful in achieving efficiency and service quality.



 



EUCI has put together a covey of expert speakers to review and address the latest PBR developments and applications.  Join us in Denver and get the latest state-of-the-art information and insights you will need to develop an effective PBR strategy for your company.



 



The website links for the Workshop and Conference are provided below:



Performance-Based Ratemaking: Theory and Applications Workshop, Dec. 5, 2001, Denver, CO

Electric Power Market Performance Conference



December 12-14, 2001, Denver, CO



OVERVIEW



 



Each year there is additional opportunity to draw lessons regarding electricity market structure and design from actual market performance. These lessons are leading to a convergence in market design, at least in the Eastern Interconnection and ERCOT. One focus of this conference will be on the lessons to be drawn from the experience of the new ERCOT markets, the continuing market design problems in California, and the difficulties in developing and implementing a market based congestion management system in the midwest.



 



A second focus of this conference will be on the existing markets in PJM and New York, which have now moved beyond managing their internal markets and are being pushed by market participants and regulatory agencies to better address inter-RTO coordination and develop market based incentive systems for transmission expansion.



 



Finally, the conference will highlight one of the important, but little noticed successes of the Eastern ISOs, which is the explosive growth in the PJM and New York financial rights auctions.

 Electric Risk Management 101 Workshop 



And



Portfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference



January 22-25, 2001, New York City, NY



OVERVIEW



 



In the current environment of volatile energy prices and deregulation, it has become increasingly more important for the electricity industry to learn how to manage price risk. EUCI presents two events formatted for the beginner to the expert in price risk management. The first Workshop is designed for the beginner with no prior experience in risk management and introduces the basic vocabulary and concepts in a concise and easily understandable format which forms the foundation for the more advanced concepts applied in the second event (Conference).



 



The website links for these events are provided below:



Electricity Risk Management 101 Workshop, Jan. 22-23, 2002, New York City, NY



<http://www.euci.com/wrkshpoverview.asp?ConfID=13&WrkshpID=8>

<http://www.euci.com/confoverview.asp?ConfID=13>

We are nearing the final form of the document for further use.  I have asked Bradford to speak with you regarding use of it for major trading counterparties that may not be investment grade, but with whom Credit sees the ability to greatly enhance our liquidity via netting of margin requirements (not the small accounts).



Two issues.



1.  Do you think we should write a risk memo concerning the issues surrounding the ultimate effectiveness under the Code and square setoff rights?  Basically, the intent would be to clarify that if a court did not enforce the close-out netting, and then did not enforce the square setoff, our collateral position on a trading master by trading master basis could be underwater because we would have netted the positions under the master netting agreement for margining purposes.  Further to this, the bankruptcy reform aspects of this issue are not moving as previously hoped due to consumer issues and current events.



2.  FYI:  It has come to my attention this week that Global Finance has consummated a receivable financing, and desires to consummate additional such financings which conflict with master netting agreements in place (as well as setoff language in trading contracts) and with the general concept of master netting for the future.  We are meeting tomorrow with Bradford and Global Finance representatives to gather facts, sort through the issues, and try to resolve what appear to be different objectives concerning trading receivables.  From a cash perspective, I would think Enron as whole would get more benefit from master netting (dollar for dollar benefit) than loan security (which would never be a dollar for dollar benefit)--do you think this is a correct analysis?

Could I ask the two of you to please insure that there is a refreshed view on the legal risks relative to both our and El Paso's litigation on East Coast Power.



If this has already been covered, then I apologize.  I just want to make sure Louise has the best data points for making a decision on my proposal of this morning.

Please let me know if you are working on any netting or collateral arrangements in support of our European trading businesses, so that we can maintain a consistent approach.



Similarly, please also be sure to contact Mary Cook who is the lawyer in Houston co-ordinating our netting and collateral arrangements with trading counterparties, many of whom trade in both Europe and the US.

Many thanks for your assistance yesterday. Clinton Energy Management Services, Inc. because it holds a current power marketing certificate is an entity which we would like to move to being a direct subsidiary of Enron Corp. to take effect today. This is considered to be an essential part of restructuring to meet our current and future needs. 

    

While the day to day control will remain where it is and all the efforts assign contracts and other work should progress as planned, since the value to Enron Corp. is the power marketing certificate nothing should be done to jeopardize this. In addition we will be changing the charter and will need copies of the existing charter to effect those changes required.

    

Please call me if you need to discuss this further.

Attached is the file you requested.  I have made substantial assumptions regarding the requested content, and the content provided may not be what was intended to be requested.



Please note the following:



- The EREC earnings figures are from the Hyperion system as of Oct. 19th

- The 2001-02 Expenses are from the 3CE and 2002 Plan respectively.  The cost-type breakdown requested is not available.

- The cash burn rate is net and ties to the change in the Enron Working Capital line balance by period. I do not have visibility to the gross outflows due to format differences.



Please call with any questions.

JANETTE: PLEASE CAN YOU ENSURE THAT MARK RECEIVES THIS EMAIL



As requested by Mark Evans, I attach the letter that West LB want us to issue in relation to Enron Corp rescinding the letter of credit request sent on Monday from Houston, which stated that we could not make the material litigation representation,  and now issuing an unqualified letter of credit request form.  I have attached an email containing the original request form for your information.



Please note that West LB have specifically demanded the inclusion of the last sentence to the first paragraph.  They are unfortunately now very sensitive to this issue and may still want oral confirmation on our change of tack. 



It should be noted that West LB is a party to the Enron Corp revolver (although through their New York branch, whereas this Facility is with West LB London Branch) and thus privy to the drawdown request given last week.



If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Mark Evans, Marcus Von Bock or me.

For VP level & above, I had the team pull by individual a recap of payroll information from SAP.  This extract shows all the current  payroll buckets that contain some type of reportable compensation.  We then took that information & broke it into fixed  and variable pay components.  The attached spreadsheet provides you an individual/job group summary for the fixed vs. variable pay components on a consolidated basis.   The variable pay amounts include ad-hoc payments for options, annual/retention bonus payments, tax settlements/refunds, etc.  Based on our conversation, my sense is that for budgeting purposes, you will need to utilize the fixed total amounts.



PLEASE NOTE - while the fixed pay components have been annualized, the variable pay components represent only those amounts recorded in the payroll system to date.  Also, I understand there may be changes to the flex dollar amounts - but I do not yet know the details.  I've checked with Executive Compensation to determine whether there might be a change in the Flexperq amounts - am still waiting for input.  I will advise you of any changes I hear with regard to these elements. 



Additionally, on the fixed side, you should also budget some merit dollars - I would suggest 4-5%.  We do not know the amount yet - but I think that should be consistent with past practice.





Tracy - if you need anything else, please let me know.

Just a quick question while I remember, as you know I am giving an overview of the DASH process and the Legal Risk Memo that must accompany any DASH.

My understanding is that the Legal Risk Memo must be attached to the DASH when the DASH is circulated and that on the face of the DASH form prepared by RAC, we should not be and there should not appear any Legal Risk assessment, which must only be contained in the Legal Risk Memo. The DASH should simply refer to See attached Legal Risk Memo.

    

I am hoping that this is also how you like to see the process work in practice.



In addition I am going to say that if possible you need to be briefed and receive a draft of the Legal Risk Memo before it is circulated with the DASH.

    

#sig#See you shortly.

The resume for Jeff Huff was inadvertently dropped from the message we sent yesterday evening.  The resume is attached below for your convenience.  



Below are a few points for your review:



Resume: Currently the second most productive Partner at Diamond-Cluster, a technology consulting firm. He has been a consultant dedicated to Enron for the last 2+ years, first for Tom Gros in EBS and Net Works and then for Dan Reck in Freight, developing trading systems. 

The Job: We are looking to bring Jeff in as VP, Commercial Support.  The demands of growing the group require a consistent focus on technology, expenses, front and back office productivity, as well as constant re-analysis of growth strategies. 

Justification: Jeff's capabilities in these areas make him extremely qualified. We rely on him heavily already, but at consulting rates he costs us more than $1.3mm per year and his focus is limited to technology. Most importantly, the lead commercial folks in the group are overburdened with administrative issues and spending too little time bringing in earnings. 

#sig# Thank you.

The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth.  Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.  This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.



(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)



Feedback and Evaluation

Employees will solicit 360? feedback on their performance via the PEP system. The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year.  The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations.  The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.  No overall performance rating will be designated.



?   PEP System open for feedback            November 19 - December 7

?   Performance discussions with supervisor December 10 - January 14

?   Written evaluations due to HR           January 15



Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.



Compensation

Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary.  Division Head approval is required.



As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance. Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.



Relative Talent Reviews

Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.  The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.  Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.  Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.  Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.  EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.  Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions.



If you have any questions about any aspect of this year-end process, I encourage you to contact your HR representative.

Attached is a sample term sheet for a common stock acquisition that could be helpful as a starting point for the Mariner transaction.  If the Mariner transaction will be structured as a stock exchange, I am not sure how helpful this will be.  I have not located any term sheets for a stock exchange, but I will be glad to begin drafting one at your request.  Also attached is a running list of issues and a listing of the portfolio assets Scott had indicated may move into Mariner and the current ownership of those assets.

I have not been able to locate any other term sheets that are tailor-made to purchases of oil and gas properties (most of the documents we have are related to financing someone else's acquisition of properties).  However, Nancy Corbet has a template for an oil and gas property purchase and sale agreement that we could review and use to beef up our standard LOI and term sheet if you wanted to go that route.  Let either of us know if you want to see that document, or if we can help out on the project.

Netting Legislation Update



House (Financial Services Committee/Toomey) and Senate (Gramm) staff met

this afternoon to agree on provisions for a stand-alone netting bill that is

likely to be brought-up under a suspension vote in the House next week.

This morning Gramm's office indicated that most of the bill looked fine

(including the Section 562 modification) except for the 907A provisions,

which they believed to be covered in the October 4 SEC-CFTC Rule on

Customer protection, Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Bankruptcy Rules and the

Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 to Accounts Holding Security

Futures Products.  We are currently vetting this view with the CFTC and

SEC. Gramm's staff (Linda Lord/Sarah DuMont) reiterated their concern in

this afternoon's meeting.  

Apologies for the late notice but we have been asked for our views today as

to whether we wish to keep the provisions in the underlying bill or if we

support dropping the provisions. We would like to schedule a conference call

ASAP to receive your views about these provisions.

Mark -



I believe this is in relation to the costs for Phase I of the legal website, including development costs.  



If so, it seems all Net Work costs were previously billed to one project code and not tracked per project.  I have discussed this with Kevin Presto and others in IT.  The problem is they want use to pay for X% of the costs based upon an estiamte that we incurred X% of the time associated with those costs.  I have consistently told IT that I needed to have more concrete numbers and support before I can bring it to you for approval and payment.  



If Louise's e-mail is about this subject, I'll continue to follow the same line until I am able to get sufficient back-up to support the fees.

This is a preliminary working session  where we (ETS only) will be developing specs that we can provide to Sunrise, communicating our detailed business requirements.  The specs will be given to Sunrise and they will have to let us know if they can do the work and how much it will cost ETS.  Greg Lewis has arranged for a facilitator to help keep us on course during the day.



We have asked you to attend as representative for the Consolidations group.  While we might finish before the end of the day, we believe it is important that most participants reserve the full day in the event we need that much time.  If Tracy or James can attend all or some of the session that would be excellent.



The meeting with Sunrise is scheduled for Friday, November 30, at 11:00 a.m. and Tracy is on the attendee list for that meeting.

Jerry, I received a copy of an email you addressed to Bill Brown regarding a conversation you had with Karen Choyce about who is responsible for Unclaimed Property Reporting to the States.  The Corporate Secretary Division centralized this function a few years ago and I am the person responsible for making sure that Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries stay in compliance.



I think Karen meant that it is the responsibility of each business unit to identify the unclaimed checks, move the funds to the Escheat Liability Account, communicate this information to the Corporate Secretary's Division, and reconcile the general ledger as it pertains to their business unit.



It is my responsibility to prepare the reports and remit the funds to the applicable state before the deadline.  Please forward any correspondence you receive from the States regarding this matter (including notices and forms) to my attention for further handling.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Orlando;

Sorry.  I realized last night I had forgot.  We can send you an OPIC

brochure with the pricing tables included but the relevant section shows

under a category called institutional loans and leases and the subheading is

expropriation cover.  The range of pricing quoted is .40 to .90 annually

i.e. 40 to 90 basis points annually.  OPIC typically requires the annual

premium to be paid in advance.



I will try to track down the Electrobolt points today.

Attached is a draft press for Coburg Power regarding our decision not to renew our exclusivity agreement.  Any thoughts?



They do not have a planned release date yet, but we expect it to be sometime this week or next once they have received approval from us.



#sig##name#Eric
Mark nothing has changed since our meeting last week, but here's a quick summary for your convenience:



 1. Deliberation 15: COMAE (board for ASMAE, which acts as the clearinghouse for the MAE) issued Deliberation 15 directing ASMAE to do its accounting without applying Annex V by Oct. 31, 2001.  The generators object because without Annex V,  they are 20% short instead 5% short.  Elektro and the LDCs object because failure to apply Annex V ignores the contract which is registered with the MAE, and a 20% long position will never be upheld.  Deliberation 15 further directs ASMAE to gather and supply to the generators and LDCs the information for application of Annex V, seven days prior to Oct 31.  This is good because it gives Elektro the information it needs to calculate the set off against the generators for its 5% long position.  Thus, it is unnecessary for Elektro to seek an injunction against ASMAE compelling the information.  



2. Letter to COMAE/ASMAE:  To preserve its position, Elektro sent a letter objecting to the COMAE's failure to direct ASMAE to apply Annex V.  The letter confirms a list of information LDCs require for the calculation.  If the information is not provided or is delayed, Elektro will go to court to compel the information.  Once it gets the information, Elektro can go to court  to force ASMAE to apply Annex V.  Prior to taking the set off, Elektro will seek an injunction to protect its assets from seizure by the generators under Annex VI. Subsequently, Elektro will file a suit against the generators to enforce the contractual application of Annex V.



3.  Two suits are being filed immediately to compel ANEEL to permit Elektro to recover or pass through various costs increases pursuant to its concession agreement.

 -----Original Appointment-----
I had a meeting with Dan Pribble and Barney Brasher this morning reviewing the current status of the TW Operation forecast.  It appears, at this point in time, that we have been able to clear up and cover all the unplanned expenditures, except for a remaining stretch of approximately $1,000,000.   We are working with all entities within ETS Operations on NNG and TW to find ways and means to cover this remaining stretch between the two companies (TW) and (NNG) during the month of December.



Since late October, Barney and his team have uncovered expenses on TW in the amount of approximately $3 million that was not covered in the Fourth Quarter forecast.   We have cleaned up all but the remaining $1 million.



Dan and Barney have both held meetings face to face with the parties involved in forecasting, or lack of it, and are implementing corrective actions.



We really appreciate the massive effort all personnel are taking to help alleviate this situation and we within OSS have implemented tighter controls and reviews on all the Business Units.   We will initiate weekly flash reviews and monitor closely the processing of all expense invoices during the month of December.  If you have any futher insights of means to relieve this situation, please advise.

During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.



The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.



The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Dear Alan,

 

As per below, Caroline is going to send off a blank contract this afternoon to Yoshimi.

 

I have only one concern and it relates to the Jim Derrick and Mark Haedicke approval - condition subsequent to the contract.  

 

If we get the go ahead from Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman by Friday, and if Yoshimi accepts our offer and signs the contract and rejects Cargill's offer, is it possible that Jim and Mark, in making their determination, would take into consideration any issues beyond her personally I wonder?

 

What I am trying to get a feel for (and I am not meaning to be rude or insulting) is, is it possible in your view that management could see this as another way of getting out of the contract with Yoshimi if bad turns to worse for the company.  The thing is that I know she is ready to take Cargill's offer.  If she rejects them, having accepted our offer and then Jim / Mark turn her down because of big picture stuff, this would be very unfortunate for her.

 

Please don't misunderstand my question, I know that Jim / Mark don't tend to turn people down at all after they have been through the recruitment process, but the company is at the same time facing an unprecedented set of circumstances so it is worth checking this I think.

 

#sig#Thanks.

To my knowledge there are a variety of prepay forms of transactions.  

1.  Some older forms were physically based (I think primarily with respect to gas and with Chase).  Teresa Bushman and/or Dan Lyons worked on these transactions).  

2.  Newer forms are triangulated swaps.  There are a series with Citibank, related to credit link notes (see Gareth Bahlmann re link notes), known as Yosemite/Delta Transactions.  There are 4 in the series (4th series had three prepays, US, Sterling and Euro).  The 5th did not close.  

3.  There is at least one other with Citibank, dated June 2001 and it is being wrapped into the pipeline credit facility and will be extinguished via the placement of the pipeline facility.  

4.  I am aware of one other (via the London office) which was extended September 2001, among Credit Suisse First Boston and ENA and Barclays.  



I suggest you contact Lisa Bills, Joe Deffner and Dan Boyle to determine a complete list.  I believe that this detail may have been determined by one of the teams formed last week.  You may wish to check with Haedicke.

In respect of accounting treatment, and book treatment, I suggest the following names:  Alan Quaintance, Clint Walden re accounting.  Dan Boyle has a name of someone who worked on placing the Delta transactions in the risk books, but I cannot remember the name.

Pat,



I mentioned to Jan that I would provide ETS (and other BUs) with specific Adaytum project expense coding which has been used for previous training classes. She said it didn't matter to her if the business units coded their additional training classes to its own expense account, without charging the costs directly to the expense work order which Project Sunrise set up. Therefore, you do not need to transfer the costs which you have already coded to expense on ETS' books.

ANS 06:23 STATE AUDITOR OFFENDED OVER EMU ALLEGATIONS



R ECS BLG XQKH

STATE AUDITOR OFFENDED OVER EMU ALLEGATIONS



    (ANSA) - Rome, November 6 - Italy's State Auditor General

Andrea Monorchio today said he was deeply offended by

allegations in the foreign press that Italy had juggled the

books in order to qualify for European Monetary Union (EMU)at

the end of the 1990s.

     The allegations, appearing in Britain's Financial Times and

The Guardian, as well as the Wall Street Journal, involved

Italy's use of a currency swap to disguise the exact amount of

its deficit in order to meet the parameters to join the euro.

  According to Monorchio, these allegations were mental

masturbation.

     Yesterday's press reports were based on a report by the

International Securities Market Association (ISMA), a

self-regulatory organization, and the Council on Foreign

Relations, an independent US-research group, in which a case was

outlined where a European country appeared to have used the

derivatives market to hide the exact size of its budget deficit.

     Although Italy was never named in the report, the FT said,

the report cited a case in which a 1995 bond issue was used in a

1997 currency swap aimed at temporarily reducing a country's

budget deficit. This example, the FT said, coincided exactly

with what happened with Italy's 1995 200 billion yen bond issue.

     Italy's qualification for EMU was orchestrated by

then-Premier Romano Prodi, now president of the European

Commission, and then-Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,

Italy's current head of state.

     I am deeply offended, Monorchio said on the sidelines of

a meeting here with the Industrialists Union, I worked very

long and hard with Ciampi. We closed 1997 with a spending

deficit of 2.7% (of GDP) because the European Union would not

allow us to calculate nine trillion lire in revenue from the

sale of gold reserves. Otherwise our budget deficit would have

been, according to Eurostat, 2.4-2.5%.

     After recalling that the EU yesterday was quick to deny

that Italy had in any way juggled its books, Monorchio added

Can anyone seriously imagine someone like President Ciampi

involved in such skulduggery?

     I myself am just a simple accountant and intend to remain

one, he concluded.

Italy rebuts claims over swap contract

Financial Times (North American Edition) - November 5, 2001

By James Blitz 



The Italian Treasury firmly rebutted allegations on Monday that it had

structured a complicated swaps contract with the aim of deflating its 1997

budget deficit figure and qualifying for the single European currency. 



In a formal statement, the Treasury said that swap contracts - in which a

bond issuer can trade his obligation to make payments in one currency rather

than another - were a regular method of improving management of public

debt. 



Privately, meanwhile, Treasury officials sought to explain why Italy had

undertaken a swap contract highlighted over the weekend by a report for the

International Securities Market Association. 



On May 15 1995 the Italian government issued a bond for Y200bn. At the time,

after the dramatic 1992 devaluation of the lira, the Italian Treasury was

gradually seeking to regain credibility in international markets, and did so

by issuing bonds in a range of currencies. 



When the Y200bn bond was issued, the yen-lira exchange rate was at L19.3. By

December 1996, however, the yen had depreciated by 30 per cent to a level of

L13.4 to the yen. The Treasury then sought to lock in its currency gains

over this period. 



Treasury officials say they could have undertaken to start buying back the

Y200bn bond issue, but given its sheer size, this was unrealistic. They

therefore decided to undertake a cross-currency swap in which the Treasury

could convert its yen liabilities into lira. 



The Treasury faced a serious technical problem, however. Under European

Union statistical rules pertaining at the time, the debt of all EU countries

could only be reported in the original currency in which the bonds had been

issued, in this case yen. 



Any swap contract agreed by the Treasury in order to close its foreign

exchange risk would thus be irrelevant when it came to calculating the

overall debt figure. 



This was highly pertinent to how the swap agreement had to be structured. 



The Italian Treasury could have simply closed the swap transaction when the

Y200bn bond matured in September 1998, realising all its exchange rate gains

at that date. But a strong appreciation of the yen during the course of 1997

might have left Italy's official debt looking higher at the end of that year

than it did at the end of 1996. This could have seriously undermined the

country's bid to enter the eurozone. 



The Treasury therefore needed to keep the formal calculation of its debt

consistent by realising their exchange rate gain during the lifetime of the

bond. Both the exchange rate and the interest rate of the swap contract were

structured to allow this. 



Treasury officials say the 30 per cent foreign exchange gain from the Y200bn

bond was highly unusual. They dismissed any notion that this could be a

regular phenomenon in debt management as absurd. 



Nor, say officials, could the swap be judged as a way of window dressing

the deficit figure. If window dressing had taken place, Italy would have

seen its deficit and debt shoot up after it had successfully entered the

single currency. The fact remains that Italy's deficit and debt have both

been on a steadily downward path since 1996.



Rome 'did not cheat over deficit' 

Financial Times - November 6, 2001 (European Edition)

By Peter Norman



The European Commission and Eurostat, the European Union's statistical

agency, yesterday rejected suggestions that Italy had used the

over-the-counter derivatives market to camouflage the true size of its

budget deficit and so help its admission to the European single currency. 



Gerassimos Thomas, spokesman for Pedro Solbes, the economic and monetary

affairs commissioner, said the Commission's preliminary evaluation was that

the use of interest rate swap transactions by one member state in 1997, as

highlighted in an International Securities Market Association (ISMA) report,

did not amount to cheating on the budget deficit figures. 



Mr. Thomas said the purpose of such swap transactions was to save money for

governments and they were therefore not discouraged by regulators. Although

the ISMA report referred only to an unnamed member state, it was understood

to be Italy. 



Yves Franchet, the director-general of Eurostat, said his agency knew in

1997 about the Y200bn Italian bond issue and swap transaction mentioned

anonymously in the report. The effect of that deal was to reduce Italy's

deficit of around 2.7 per cent of gross domestic product in 1997 by a

marginal 0.02 percentage points. 



The swap deal was therefore not of a size to influence significantly Italy's

ability to produce a deficit well below the 3 per cent ceiling set in the

Maastricht Treaty. 



Mr. Franchet said Eurostat consulted widely on how to treat swaps before

defining the deficit of Italy and other member states. The agency had to

work out the public deficits of member states for economic and monetary

union at a time of statistical transition between national accounts based on

a standard known as ESA79, which took no account of swaps, and before formal

adoption of the ESA95 system, which recognised swaps. 



After consulting with expert committees, Eurostat decided to apply the ESA95

standard in calculating member states' suitability for Emu. Aware that swaps

could have a positive or negative effect on deficits, Eurostat also

conducted a survey of swap use by member states. According to Mr. Franchet,

the practice was not widespread. 



Cavallo defends Argentina's plan for debt swap 

Financial Times - November 6, 2001

By Thomas Catan



Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, yesterday mounted a defence

of his country's controversial debt swap plan, saying investors must accept

lower interest payments if his country was to avoid an outright default on

its Dollars 132bn debt. 



Any reasonable person knows that Argentina cannot grow if it has to pay

interest on its debt that ranges between 11 per cent to 25 per cent - and in

the case of some provinces, up to 30 per cent a year, he told an audience

of businessmen. 



We . . . seek to ensure payment on the basis that Argentina is viable and

to stop trying to pay (interest rates) that only reflect the march of

Argentina towards default. It's a question of telling the truth. 



Starting today, Argentina will offer private creditors new bonds backed by

future tax revenues that will pay a maximum of 7 per cent. Repayment on

bonds coming due in the next 10 years will also be pushed forward by three

years, Mr. Cavallo said. 



This leg of the debt restructuring appears to be aimed mainly at domestic

investors - local pension funds, insurance companies and banks - that hold

at least a third of Argentina's Dollars 95bn in bonds. These local

institutions, often units of international banks, are heavily exposed to

Argentine debt and are seen as more susceptible to government pressure. 



A second global exchange for all of Argentina's bonds should be ready

within 2-4 months, Mr. Cavallo said. By then, Argentine officials hope to

have additional guarantees from multilateral lending agencies to offer

foreign investors in return for accepting lower-interest bonds. Argentina

hopes this will enable it to avoid an outright default on its debt. 



Investors entering the first, mainly local, exchange will be entitled to

enter any subsequent deal, Mr. Cavallo said. Pension fund managers had

feared being taken to court by future retirees for having acted against

their interests. 



Those who have confidence in Argentina are going to have two opportunities

because no one knows if the global exchange will have better or worse

terms, Mr. Cavallo said. 



Argentina is attempting to cut its annual interest bill by at least Dollars

4bn to free up resources to restart its ailing economy, now in its fourth

year of recession. To do so, the government is implementing a range of tax

cuts and other measures to spark spending, such as cutting employees'

private pension contributions. 



Investors remain concerned that Argentina's debt proposal effectively

constitutes a default. However, Mr. Cavallo is now putting them on notice

that they must accept lower interest payments if the country is to continue

to service its debt.  The government is also pressing the 23 provinces to

accept a cut in their guaranteed monthly tax transfers.



After Liffe

The Economist - November 1, 2001



JEAN-FRANCOIS THEODORE, the head of Euronext, is a surprise winner. The

London Stock Exchange (LSE) was widely expected to triumph in the bidding

for Liffe, London's derivatives exchange. Yet on October 29th the board of

Liffe recommended that its shareholders accept a ?555m ($806m) offer from

Euronext, the three-way merger between the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels

stock exchanges. Although Euronext's offer was less than the LSE's, it was

all in cash (not in combination with shares). It also promised to retain

Liffe's management, and to shift all of Euronext's derivatives business to

London to trade on Connect, Liffe's trading system. That combination made it

unbeatable.



Euronext's coup is a blow for the LSE, which had hoped that buying Liffe

would strengthen its position in the forthcoming consolidation of European

stock exchanges. But the LSE misplayed its hand, advertising its interest

for too long in advance and then quibbling over too many details with

Liffe's management. It will now have to find some other strategic option if

it is not to become prey to one of its rivals. Setting up its own

derivatives business will be hard: it might instead seek to buy one of the

American exchanges, perhaps the Chicago Mercantile.



The third big European stock exchange, Deutsche B?rse, which had also bid

for Liffe, will also have to find an alternative. Yet one obvious idea, to

resurrect last year's abortive marriage between it and the LSE, will be hard

to do under the two exchanges' present management, because the bust-up was

so acrimonious. That may put Euronext in the best position to become the

dominant European exchange.



Europe's investors may not care so long as trading becomes cheaper and

easier. Anyway, most of them fret more about improving clearing and

settlement in Europe, which is much more expensive than in America and so

offers greater scope for savings. The Liffe/Euronext deal immediately

triggered speculation about which European clearing houses might now merge.

The London Clearing House (LCH), which clears trades on Liffe, had

inconclusive talks last year with Clearnet, which clears Euronext trades. A

merger would now be logical. Less obvious is which way the Luxembourg-based

Clearstream will jump. On October 31st it received offers from Deutsche

B?rse (which already owns 50%) and Brussels-based Euroclear, the biggest

clearer of international bonds.



Deutsche B?rse is keen to own all of Clearstream. This would create the

first big European silo, in which trading, clearing and settlement have a

single owner. Werner Seifert, chairman of Deutsche B?rse, has long

championed silos, which he thinks provide the reliability required by the

market. Critics reckon vertical silos distort competition. Benn Steil at the

Council on Foreign Relations in New York says that Deutsche B?rse might

impose discriminatory tariffs on non-German-based traders in German shares

if it were to own all of Clearstream. Others point to possible cross-subsidy

from the monopolised settlement arm to the trading platform.



One alternative is the horizontal integration of settlement agencies and

clearing-houses, to create large central counterparties-maybe two or three

for the whole of Europe. Traders would then be able to net their cash and

derivatives positions on several exchanges with a single clearing house,

saving capital. Don Cruickshank, chairman of the LSE, thinks the European

Commission in Brussels should go further and impose a single European

clearing and settlement system like America's. 



That is a very long shot. It took the intervention of Congress and the

Securities and Exchange Commission to set up the Depository Trust and

Clearing Corporation-which moved American non-government securities markets

from seven settlement agencies to one settlement organisation and one

central counterparty. Besides the defenders of silos, the European

Commission would have to contend with a different regulatory and legal

system in each member country. More realistically, market forces will drive

clearing and settlement houses to join forces, because it is more

cost-efficient when buyer, seller and security are linked.



Cut short

The Economist - November 1, 2001



The American Treasury's announcement that it will issue no more 30-year

bonds should delight corporate treasurers and depress fund managers. Cynics

also suggest that Peter Fisher, under-secretary at the Treasury, made this

move to help Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, bring

down long-term interest rates, in a fair imitation of a bull market.



The 30-year Treasury bond has been illiquid for some time because until

recently America had been retiring debt. Now that the country is a net

borrower again, it is the wrong time to take long-term debt off the menu,

say Mr. Fisher's critics. Many have a vested interest, however. The Chicago

Board of Trade, which usually carries great clout in Washington, immediately

protested that economic uncertainty since September 11th obliges the

Treasury to keep all its funding options open, including at the long end. It

is worried about losing its flagship 30-year-bond futures market. 



Bond traders, as well as inter-dealer brokers, such as Cantor Fitzgerald,

will now have to satisfy themselves with shorter maturities-these are more

liquid, but with less of the volatility that dealers love. Those traders and

investment banks that cover their 30-year trading positions with repos (bond

sales and repurchases) will find life more expensive-they will ultimately

have to buy and sell corporate bonds, which carry credit risk, rather than

supposedly risk-free government bonds. Perhaps they will use British 30-year

gilts instead.



There are winners. Swap dealers and long-term bond issuers, notably two

government agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, should find more demand for

their 30-year bonds. It will please, too, those who think interest-rate swap

rates a better benchmark than Treasuries for pricing fixed-income

securities.



The biggest gripe will come from insurance companies and pension funds with

long-term liabilities-especially defined-benefit pension plans. Long-term

rates may be lower but will now come with credit risk attached. Surely Mr.

Fisher read a paper published in July by the American Academy of Actuaries

entitled The Impact of Inordinately Low 30-year Treasury Rates on Defined

Benefit Plans? If he did, this plea to spare the life of 30-year Treasuries

failed to move the man of steel.

ISDA Names Mengle To New Position As Head Of Research

Dow Jones Newswires

By Joe Niedzielski



The International Swaps and Derivatives Association said Monday that it had

appointed David Mengle as head of research.



Mengle will be responsible for providing research and analytical support for

various ISDA committees and initiatives in this newly created position, ISDA

said in a press release.



In particular, Mengle will work on aspects of ISDA's risk management

activities, providing technical assistance on issues surrounding the Basel

capital accord. He will also oversee ISDA's market survey and will work to

produce surveys in other areas.



Over the past several years, Mengle assisted ISDA by conducting derivatives

operations and documentation seminars and he will continue his involvement

in this area, ISDA said.



David brings an enormous amount of industry and academic experience to

ISDA, said Robert Pickel, ISDA's executive director and CEO.



His expertise in risk management, derivatives products and regulation will

strengthen ISDA's mission to encourage the prudent and efficient development

of the privately negotiated derivatives business, Pickel said in the

statement



Mengle was most recently with the consulting firm Rutter Associates.

Previously, he was a vice president at J.P. Morgan and worked on a number of

policy and capital related issues. Prior to that, he was a research

economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

End-users Build Up Experience

IFR - November 24, 2001



End-users of credit derivatives in the US and Canada are trading an average

of 65 deals a year and make use of with six to seven traders on average,

according to a report released last week by consultant Greenwich Associates.

The larger the user, the more dealers they are using, said Peter D'Amario,

principal at Greenwich and one of the authors.



The multiple points of contact, though they complicate documentation for

end-users, indicate that end-users are learning and triangulating what they

are hearing, D'Amario said. As credit derivatives are still a relatively new

market, this strategy may assist users in benefiting from price

differentials. They are still concerned enough to go around and talk with

people, he added.



The largest and most sophisticated users of credit derivatives report an

average of 150 trades a year, according to the report. Banks were the

biggest users of credit derivatives in terms of volume. Reinsurers and

insurers, fund mangers and hedge funds, in that order, filled in the ranking

of users, said D'Amario, noting that corporates ranked last on the list of

users.



About one-third of the corporates interviewed for the survey said they did

not use credit derivatives. However, no other grouping is looking so

aggressively at becoming involved in the market in the future. Roughly half

of the corporates not currently using credit derivatives stated an intention

to use them within the next year. The inter-dealer market was excluded from

the survey.



Although [end-users] are using six or seven dealers, they are giving 80% of

their business to three of their top dealers. The other three or four are

fighting for 20% of the business, said D'Amario.



That's unsustainable. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a contraction in

the average number of dealing relationships. Firms that do not offer a

broad product array may be knocked out first. Greenwich said the dealers

that fare best in its rankings are those that offer a depth and breadth of

relationships, product knowledge, structuring ability and an understanding

of client needs, D'Amario said.



About 40% of end-users cited a relationship as a reason for picking a

dealer, though 53% listed competitive quotes as their top reason for

selecting a dealer. When we asked people that, right off the bat they say

competitive quotes. Then, we derive from data what [it is that] correlates

with being one of a user's top three dealers. It is never competitive

quotes. The real reason for selecting a dealer is relationships, D'Amario

said.



Treasury's Bair: Congress Should Pass Netting Laws This Year

Dow Jones - November 26, 2001

By Rebecca Christie



A senior Treasury official said Friday that Congress should find a way to

pass so-called netting legislation, even if more broad-based bankruptcy

legislation stalls.



Sheila Bair, assistant secretary for financial institutions, told an

American Bar Association committee that there was an immediate need for the

proposal, which would make it easier for banks and businesses to settle

financial contracts if one of the parties becomes insolvent.



The relevant provisions are a non-controversial portion of broader

legislation to revise the bankruptcy laws. We are concerned, however, that

the controversial issues of the broader legislation may not be resolved soon

enough to allow its passage this year, Bair said.



The proposed changes would limit market disruptions in the event of

insolvency and also reduce the risks to federally regulated participants and

to the overall financial system, Bair said.



Whether as part of comprehensive bankruptcy reform legislation or as a

stand-alone bill, we believe that Congress should enact netting legislation

this year. Further delays would unnecessarily place the financial system at

greater risk, Bair said.



Momentum Builds For US Derivatives Insolvency Bill

Dow Jones - November 26, 2001

By Dawn Kopecki



The nation's leading securities trading groups urged congressional leaders

Tuesday to pass legislation that allows financial institutions and

corporations to close out their derivatives contracts during an insolvency.



The current economic climate, worsened by the tragedy of Sept. 11, has made

passage of these provisions...critical to the systemic risk reduction given

the combination of market disruption and economic uncertainty, reads a

letter sent Tuesday to House and Senate leaders from The Bond Market

Association, The Financial Services Roundtable, International Swaps and

Derivatives Association, the Futures Industry Association and a half dozen

other financial organizations.



Pressure to pass the legislation has mounted since the Sept. 11 terrorist

attacks shut down U.S. financial markets and destroyed the Manhattan offices

of many Wall Street brokerage houses.



Even though no company went under as a result of the market disruption, the

fear of institutional failures has grown, and support is mounting for

passing the provision apart from the controversial bankruptcy bill to which

it is attached.



The measure allows institutions to quickly close outstanding derivatives

with bankrupt trading partners by netting all the losses and gains of

individual contracts into one deal.



Congress should not fail to enact netting legislation this year, Federal

Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill wrote

House lawmakers last month. Further delays would unnecessarily place the

financial system at greater risk.



But congressional support for tightening U.S. bankruptcy laws has dwindled

in the face of a probable recession. As a result, Rep. Pat Toomey, R-Pa.,

introduced the netting measure as its own bill in the House last week.



Although we support passage of these provisions as part of the larger

bankruptcy-reform legislation....we share concerns of the key financial

regulators that broader (bankruptcy) legislation may not be resolved soon

enough to allow passage this year, the trade groups wrote. We urge you and

your leadership team to pass (netting legislation) as quickly as possible so

that we do not miss an opportunity for enactment this year.



German regulator may follow US 

Financial Times - November 27, 2001

By Bertrand Benoit



The integration of European capital markets means Germany's securities

regulator will need to model itself increasingly on the US Securities and

Exchange Commission, according to Georg Wittich, the German authority's

chairman.



One should examine whether the SEC might not be the appropriate structure

for securities regulation in the future, Mr Wittich said in an interview.



We will have to go towards more centralisation at the German level as the

need arises for increased co-operation between reg-ulators at the European

level.



Created in 1994, the Frankfurt-based Federal Supervisory Office for

Securities Trading, or BAWe, is one of the few financial markets regulators

in Europe not to act as supervisor for the stock exchange. For historical

reasons, this responsibility lies with the government of the state of Hesse.



Although BAWe is responsible for overseeing companies' official

announcements to financial market participants, it has no power to

investigate suspected cases of market manipulation and no authority to

approve share offer prospectuses if they are linked to a public listing.



While it is mandated to investigate insider trading, the authority has no

right to sue or sanction offenders. Instead, it must transfer all suspected

cases to a public prosecutor for criminal investigation. In practice, few

insider-trading cases ever reach court.



A planned bill, recently adopted by the German government and set for

approval by parliament next year, would make BAWe responsible for fighting

market manipulation, including the key prerogative to file civil claims

against suspected offenders.



From January, the authority will also be responsible for enforcing Germany's

first compulsory takeover code. Meanwhile, despite opposition from the

insurance industry and regional central banks, a draft bill by the finance

ministry should result in the merger next year of BAWe with the federal bank

and insurance regulators into a centralised financial supervisor.



Yet there is no plan to give the watchdog authority over the Frankfurt stock

exchange.



The separation of roles (with each state being responsible for policing

stock exchanges on its territory) is above all historical, says Mr Wittich.

We have a high quality of supervision, but a rapprochement in this respect

- which should be a matter the federal and state governments - is something

to think about for the future. Germany's courts chase after companies,



UK's FSA Consults On Implications Of Basel Accord Delay

Dow Jones - November 27, 2001

By Sarah Turner



The U.K.'s financial watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, said

Tuesday that it has set out for consultation the implications of a one-year

delay to the revised Basel Capital Accord on integrated prudential

supervision for U.K. financial firms.



The new Basel Accord framework is intended to improve the safety and

soundness of the financial system by placing more emphasis on banking

internal controls and management, the supervisory review process and market

discipline.  These international initiatives have been delayed until at

least the start of 2005.



The FSA's director of prudential standards, Clive Briault, said the FSA was

previously planning to implement its integrated prudential sourcebook at the

start of 2004, in line with the implementation of the new Basel Accord and

related new European Union legislation.



Briault said we believe that we should not defer all the benefits of

integrated regulation simply on account of the delays in international

discussions.  He added that our preferred option is to implement as much

as possible of the sourcebook early in 2004, while deferring those parts

which will or may have to be changed significantly as a result of the

international discussions.



Key candidates for implementation in 2004 are sourcebook provisions relating

to insurance companies, Lloyds insurance and friendly societies.  Briault

said other areas suitable for early implementation are systems and controls,

investment firms not covered by the Investment Services Directive,

operational risk and, in part, market risk.

After reviewing the budget yesterday, we noticed that goodwill was still being

amortized in 2002. We need to take that out of your numbers. Jim and Kiri

thought it was approximately $14 million. Thus, PGG should have an IBIT of

$270. Please revise file and send back to me and copy Steve Schwarzbach

thanks. 



Tracy
Please let us know if there is anything that we should NOT do or say in

relation to this in order not to harm the relationship with the Italian

regulators.

pagamento do montante devido ? contraparte transferidora na ocorr?ncia do

evento de cr?dito.

? 2? O fator de pondera??o, em valor percentual, a ser aplicado ao montante

de prote??o do ativo subjacente para fins de apura??o do PLE deve ser obtido

com base na seguinte f?rmula:

FP = (1 - F) x (PRP x 50)/PRA + [1- (PRP/PRA)] x FPA + F x FPA, onde:

FP = fator de pondera??o aplic?vel ao montante de prote??o do ativo

subjacente;

PRA = prazo remanescente do ativo subjacente (em dias ?teis);

PRP = prazo remanescente do derivativo de cr?dito (em dias ?teis);

FPA = Fator de pondera??o, em valor percentual, relativo ao ativo

subjacente, conforme a Tabela de Classifica??o dos Ativos de que trata o

art. 2?, ? 1?, do Regulamento Anexo IV ? Resolu??o 2.099, de 1994, e

altera??es posteriores;

F = zero nas hip?teses do derivativo de cr?dito ser contratado na mesma

moeda que o ativo subjacente;

F = 0,50 (cinq?enta cent?simos) nas hip?teses do derivativo de cr?dito ser

contratado em outra moeda que n?o a do ativo subjacente.

? 3? A exposi??o ao risco do ativo subjacente que exceder o montante

de prote??o deve ser ponderada pelo seu fator original conforme a Tabela de

Classifica??o dos Ativos de que trata o art. 2?, ? 1?, do Regulamento Anexo

IV ? Resolu??o 2.099, de 1994, e altera??es posteriores.

? 4? Na hip?tese em que estipulada cl?usula relativa a valores ou

percentuais m?nimos de perda do ativo subjacente para que a recomposi??o,

total ou parcial, seja efetuada, deve ser comprovada parcela adicional de

PLE equivalente ao valor ou percentual m?nimo estipulado.

Art. 4? A contraparte receptora do risco fica exposta ao risco de cr?dito do

ativo subjacente na propor??o do risco assumido.

Par?grafo ?nico. Na hip?tese de a contraparte receptora do risco

garantir o contrato de derivativo de cr?dito com a utiliza??o de recursos em

esp?cie ou de t?tulos de emiss?o de terceiros, a exposi??o ao risco

decorrente deve ser ponderada pelo maior fator de pondera??o entre aquele

aplic?vel ao ativo subjacente ao contrato de derivativo de cr?dito e aquele

aplic?vel ? contraparte transferidora do risco.

Art. 5? ? obrigat?ria a divulga??o, em notas explicativas ?s demonstra??es

financeiras, de informa??es contendo, pelo menos, os seguintes aspectos

transferidas ou recebidas no per?odo em decorr?ncia dos fatos geradores

previstos no contrato;

VII - segrega??o por tipo (swap de cr?dito e swap de taxa de retorno total).

Art. 6? O Banco Central do Brasil poder? determinar o aumento do PLE, com

base em caracter?sticas intr?nsecas ao contrato.

Art. 7? As institui??es devem manter, ? disposi??o do Banco Central

do Brasil, adequadamente documentadas, sua pol?tica e procedimentos para

realiza??o de opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito, bem como os limites de

exposi??o estabelecidos, independentemente da condi??o de receptora ou

transferidora do risco.

celebra??o de contrato de derivativo de cr?dito cujo montante seja igual ou

superior a 10% (dez por cento) valor do Patrim?nio de Refer?ncia (PR) da

institui??o que atuar como contraparte transferidora do risco.

Art. 9? A institui??o deve informar ao Departamento de Cadastro e

Informa??es do Sistema financeiro (Decad) o nome do diretor respons?vel pela

pr?tica de opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito, nos termos do art. 3? da

Doyle I, L.L.C., ENA, NEPCO, EE&CC and Power Generation Investco, L.L.P., as insureds/assignees under a policy of insurance issued by Factory Mutual Insurance Co.

Tracy,



Below are the rough cost estimates to apply drag reducing agent to the LaPlata to Bloomfield line.



    Facility modifications          $1,665,000



    Cleaning & application             $165,000



    Re-application every 6 months          $165,000





The facility modifications include a launcher at LaPlata, receiver at Bloomfield and a filter separator at the El Paso Blanco delivery.  The cleaning & application and re-applications costs include cleaning pig runs with methanol and surfactant as well costs for the actual DRA application.



For analyzing sensitivities, all costs are +/- 30%.  The re-application time period is also uncertain.  You may want to look at the economics of re-apply as often as every three months and as infrequently as every 12 months.



Please let me know of anything else you need.

Tracy,

There is no detail of the O&M expense as has been requested.  I read Valerie's note about how they're not geared toward providing that because of their FERC COA vs. SAP.  The allocations page possibly, but they will likely need to provide their best estimate of all of the O&M detail.  However, given that their sale is pending, I don't know what level of scrutiny will be afforded to PGE's costs.  I will check with Lindsey, Butts, et.al. to see.



Also, their file is linked to all of their source files.  This is unacceptable - this exposes our model to linking complications (their file opens up with a manual calculation required to update the numbers) and causes rounding errors.  Please have them enter in their numbers as requested initially: $ in millions, to one decimal point in the cell (for example, a cell may reflect 4.5, but the cell actually contains 4.5211114598793546 because of the links --- we need the cell to reflect and contain just 4.5 .)



Call me and we'll discuss.



#sig#Thanks,

Enron Transportation Services has 2115 outstanding invoices totaling nearly $8.5 million, which need coding and/or approval in the iPayit system.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, ETS employees need to do their part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors.  

 

If you purchase items that generate an invoice (including cell phones, pagers, etc.) or if you are responsible for coding and/or approving invoices, after you receive your e-mail notification, please log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action to process the invoice (s) .  

 

Because the invoice (s)  cannot be processed for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox, it's important to code/approve invoices within five (5) days of e-mail notification.  

 

I expect ETS to stay current on payment of ALL vendor invoices.  

 

I have approved invoices in the system and it's very to use.  We will continue to monitor the status of our accounts payable, and we expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.

 

If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Carolyn Centilli at 713-345-8496.   Password questions should be directed to the ISC help desk, 713-345-4727.

  

Thank you for your commitment to improving our accounts payable process and for paying our vendors on time.

I understand that AA may not provide the review of interim financial information that the SEC requires to be obtained in respect of Form 10-Q filings ( Article 10 of Regulation SX).  Jordan asked me to give an update in an hour about the impact of this on covenants in ENE credit and other instruments requiring delivery of ENE's 10Qs.



(1) I have not yet been able to ascertain whether (i) the AA review or any statement in respect thereof is required to be filed with the SEC, or (ii) if not so required, ENE would file the 10-Q without having obtained the review.  



(2) ENE's 364-day corporate revolver (and most other ENE instruments containing the subject covenant) requires ENE to make available either on EDGAR or ENE's home page on World Wide Web, or otherwise make available to the Banks promptly after the filing or sending thereof, and in any event within 75 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters, a copy of ENE's report on Form 10-Q.  If ENE does not file the 10-Q, it arguably could nevertheless send it to the banks as confidential information (to comply with Regulation FD) within the required time period and satisfy the covenant.  The revolver contains a confidentiality provision.

Failure to deliver the 10-Q constitutes an Event of Default under the revolver if the failure continues for more than 30 days after ENE has received notice thereof by the Paying Agent.



I will continue to pursue information from the accountants.

One further note:  Failure to timely file a conforming Form 10-Q violates SEC rules and regulations.  The revolver also contains a covenant requiring ENE to comply with laws, rules, regulations and orders to the extent noncompliance therewith would have a material adverse effect on ENE and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.  Failure to so comply constitutes an Event of Default under the revolver if the failure continues for more than 30 days after ENE is given notice thereof by the Paying Agent.  Thus, even if ENE confidentially provided an unfiled Form 10-Q to the Banks to satisfy the financial reporting covenant, a failure to file might breach the legal compliance covenant.

Credit Derivatives

FOW - November 7, 2001

By Jane Douglas-Jones



In the weeks following the terrorist attacks in the US, credit derivative

traders reported record levels of activity. In the immediate aftermath of

the events of 11 September trade ticket size went down, says one broker. A

lot of people were prepared to make markets in $5m or euros where previously

the average ticket size was $10-15m. The nominal size of the trade went down

as a result of the level of uncertainty and volatility in the markets.



Traders report that credit default swap trade volume soared to three times

the normal level. If nominal ticket value went down by half and trade

volume went up three-fold, overall volumes were up by 5 00/0 in terms of the

actual business being written, explains the broker.  After the initial

shock of the devastating attacks, the market recovered its poise and

analysts and traders soon realised the credits that would be most affected.



Clearly, airline stocks took a pummelling, says one trader. Prior to the

event, British Airways was trading around 100 basis points for five year

default swaps. After the attacks, BA widened dramatically to 350/SOObp.

Spreads on this credit did come in from this level, but they have since gone

back out again and are currently trading around 380/450bp. Meanwhile, we saw

a credit event on Swiss Air, and German airline Lufthansa also went out,

with all the European airlines following suit.



Insurance sector

As was expected, the credit derivatives market also saw heightened activity

in the insurance and reinsurance sector. There has been a lot of activity

around companies such as Zurich Re, says the trader. Zurich spreads moved

out from around 20/40bp to 50/100bp. The credit did trade towards the

offered side once or twice. Zurich spreads have stayed in this range despite

the fact that the company has downsized its profits and upsized its

predicted loss (effectively doubling the amount of provision) as a result of

the terrorist attacks.



Similarly, names such as AXA, Agon, and Aliance have all been actively

quoted in the aftermath of 11 September and spreads have widened

considerably on these names. For example, as FOW went to press Aliance

spreads went out to 7Obp before tracking back in to 35/55bp. In addition,

sectors that have not been considered directly affected by the attacks, such

as the auto sector, also moved out as a result of the potential slowdown in

the US.



We have seen principle investors in the credit derivatives market trading

either with a view or going by what the spot markets are doing, says one

dealer. We have also seen quite a few investors gaining synthetic exposure

to bonds by selling default swaps.  Recent weeks have proved a significant

test of the liquidity in the default swaps market. In some areas, the bond

market was extremely thin and it was difficult to trade. However, with

default swaps there was always a price in no more than five minutes. The

market was both traded and tradable.



Europe

The European credit derivatives market has also had to contend with the

demise of the UK's train operator, Railtrack. Railtrack is going to be a

credit event on bankruptcy rather than restructuring, says one structurer.

There was a thought initially that it would go via restructuring and that

would have been an interesting test of the modified ISDA restructuring

supplement. This is still very much an issue in the market. While the US has

adopted the new version, by far the majority of business being done in

Europe and Asia uses the original ISDA 1999 definition of restructuring. The

new restructuring Z supplement has simply not been accepted and I do not

think it ever will be accepted. I expect that we will soon move back along

the lines of the original ISDA wording with perhaps one or two tweaks. 



Overall, traders say that the market has survived the seismic shock of the

events of 11 September extremely well. There was no mad panic, says one

broker. The credit derivatives market made a fair and measured response in

the face of tragedy. 





ISDA publishes amendments to master agreements

IFR - November 3, 2001



As part of its effort to improve counter-party risk management practices,

the International Swaps and Derivatives Association last week released nine

amendments that can be added as attachments to ISDA master agreements. Many

of the changes included in the document were inspired by the market

turbulence in 1998, ISDA said. Ultimately, the amendments will form the

basis of an initial draft of a new master agreement.



Using one amendment, a failure to pay becomes a default one local delivery

day after notice of such failure is given to the relevant party. Many

market participants found three local business days after notice to be too

long a period during times of market stress in 1998 ISDA noted in a

commentary on the amendments. A local delivery day is a day on which

settlement systems are generally open for business.



Under a second amendment, market participants can use a replacement value

method of valuing transactions after early termination of a master

agreement. The replacement method combines elements of the market quotation

and loss methods into one valuation provision, 1SDA said, noting that the

quotation or loss methods are still valid. Because the inability to

communicate notices via email or fax proved unduly restrictive in 1998, an

amendment was added allowing market participants to use these channels to

give notices.



An amendment stating that the occurrence of termination events should be

treated in a manner similar to an event of default also featured on ISDA's

new list of amendments that may be tacked on to master agreements.

According to ISDA, this option was added because a number of members hold

the view that most termination events are credit-related.



ISDA initiated a review of its master agreements' provisions in 1999. The

process took into account recommendations by the counter-party risk

management policy group's 1999 report Improving Counter-Party Risk

Management.





Emerging market issuers press ahead 

Financial Times - November 7, 2001

By Arkady Ostrovsky



Emerging market borrowers are pressing ahead with planned international bond

issues, despite a deepening debt crisis in Argentina. 



Fitch, the credit rating agency, yesterday said Argentina's planned debt

swap would amount to a default. Fitch cut Argentina's credit rating from CC

to C, indicating an imminent default, and left it on rating watch negative. 



Although the proposed debt exchange has been described as voluntary, public

statements by Argentine officials imply that in the absence of such an

exchange, public debt held by domestic investors is unlikely to be

serviced, Fitch said. 



Fitch also said the terms of the new instruments would be inferior to those

of existing debt, including lower coupons and longer maturities. 



However, despite all this, emerging markets remained surprisingly calm with

no visible signs of contagion developing. Emerging markets bond spreads had

hardly moved since last Friday's announcement and the yield spread of some

countries, including Brazil, had even tightened. This is because there is

little leverage in the system, compared with the 1998 Russian crisis, and

because most market participants were prepared for an Argentine default. 



Several emerging market issuers said they were pressing ahead with bonds

despite Argentina's troubles. 



Bulgaria is likely to launch its debut euro-denominated international bond

next week. Its finance minister said yesterday the country would not launch

the bond if it had to pay a coupon above 8.5 per cent. 



But bankers close to the deal were confident Bulgaria could borrow at

between 7 and 8 per cent, or between 380 and 420 basis points over the

eurozone benchmark, depending on the maturity. Bulgaria is considering a

three-year or five-year issue of up to Euros 255m. 



Emerging market analysts said Bulgaria's economy was in good shape, despite

eurozone economic slowdown and falling export revenues. The country, rated

B2 by Moody's and B+ by Standard & Poor's, has attracted healthy levels of

foreign direct investment by selling its banks to foreign banks, has pegged

its currency to the euro and has met several Maastricht criteria. 



Bulgaria is the final country to offer extra value as an EU convergence

play. It is unrecognisable as the state engulfed by crisis five years ago,

said Charles Robertson, emerging markets analyst at ING Barings. 



Latvia, which is on a roadshow in London today, is also pushing ahead with a

bond issue. Sibneft, Russia's oil company, said it would also go ahead with

a three-year Dollars 250m bond issue this month, although other oil

companies have chosen to postpone their issues until next year. If

successful, Sibneft could become the first Russian corporate to issue

international bonds since the 1998 crisis. 



Moody's yesterday assigned Sibneft a rating of B1, a notch above Russia's

sovereign credit rating. 





Dumping W

FOW - November 2001

By Jane Douglas-Jones



Basel Committee for Banking Supervision has been busy in recent weeks. The

Committee has issued guidance to banks on customer due diligence processes,

reviewed its Internal Ratings Based Approach (EBB) to specialised lending

exposures, and published crucial papers on operational risk and market

discipline. In addition, the credit derivatives market breathed a sign of

relief at the Committee's decision to dump 'w'.

In the first of a series of updates on the proposed new Basel Capital

Accord, the Basel Committee's Capital Group has decided to incorporate the

'w' factor (a residual risk charge for credit derivatives) into pillar two

of the Accord's framework, which deals with the supervisory review process.



This move was welcomed by the banking industry and the International Swaps &

Derivatives Association (ISDA), neither of which has been backward in

expressing disapproval of 'w'. The news that the charge is to be assimilated

elsewhere in the Accord came as no surprise given the uproar since w's birth

in the January 2001 Basel consultative paper. As FOW reported (see May

issue, It's the end of

as we know it, page 21), the charge was derided, at ISDA's AGM, by the very

regulators one would expect to defend it and the future of the 'w' factor

has looked bleak since then.



However, some market participants were worried that the Committee would

stand by the charge both because of the immaturity of the credit derivatives

market and also because of the worry that credit risk management instruments

could be used for regulatory arbitrage. Any sign of traders using a

derivative to 'get around' a capital charge or regulation has been, in the

past, punished by conservative and complex rules, says one source. Recent

evidence of this can be found in the securitisation market.



The demise of 'w' has not meant the end of regulator concern about credit

derivatives. The Capital Group states: One of the Basel Committee's

objectives in considering the treatment of credit derivatives in the trading

book is to minimise the possibility of regulatory arbitrage... the Capital

Group is planning to specify a rule that is already implemented by many

supervisors. This rule provides that when a bank conducts an internal hedge

of a banking book exposure using a credit derivative in its own trading

book, in order to receive any regulatory capital benefit it must transfer

the credit risk to an outside third party (ie an eligible credit protection

provider).



Meanwhile, the Accord's add-on matrix for potential future exposure

calculations does not explicitly cover credit derivatives and rules differ

across countries. 'The Capital Group is working ~to provide proposals that

will harmonise this treatment.



Op risk

The Risk Management Group

(RMG) of the Basel Committee

has also been hard at work. The Group has made a number of significant

changes to the January proposals including:

    *   Refinement of the definition of operational risk

    *   Proposed reduction in the overall level of the operational

risk capital charge from 200/0 to 120/0

    *   Introduction of a new regulatory capital approach that is

based on banks' internal risk estimates (the Advanced Measurement

Approaches [AMA])

    *   Consideration of the role of insurance as a risk mitigant in

the regulatory capital calculations.



The Group now defines op risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate

or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.

 

Due diligence

In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the US in September, the Basel

Committee has issued guidance and minimum standards to banks on customer due

diligence processes. Systemic customer due diligence is an essential

element of banks' risk management,' says William McDonough, chairman of the

Basel Committee. It is critical 'to safeguarding confidence and the

integrity of the banking system. The importance of a rigorous approach has

been underscored by the recent terrorist attacks in the US. 





Basel Committee, IOSCO, IAIS Publish Cross-Sector Reports

Dow Jones Newswires - November 7, 2001



LONDON -- Two cross-sector reports aimed at supervisors in the banking,

securities and insurance industries were published Wednesday by the Basel

Committee on Banking Supervision, the technical committee of the

International Organization of Securities Commissions, and the International

Association of Insurance Supervisors.



The reports deal with cross-sectoral comparisons of risk management

practices and regulatory capital, and with core principles of the respective

sectors the organizations deal with.



The reports were published by the Joint Forum, established in 1996 to

examine supervisory issues related to financial conglomerates.

I've also asked VE to prepare something for us to send to our employees that addresses what we can and can't say or do in terms of sharing information with Rockne (from an anti-trust and confidentiality standpoint).

After the budget session, I thought I needed to make sure one more process is started and in order.     Insurance costs have risen and there may be a disconnect between expectations and actual results.    I would like to think that we can develop the proper insurance program for Wessex and other Operating Companies in a short time.    



    I think we will need to determine what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed and then what is the right information to send out in the request for quotes.     This is so that everyone is dealing with the same information.     I would argue that we should be able to price the deal in the market and then give the group program     a right to match the deal.    I think the next step is yours, to tell us what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed  and then follow that up with the information  to go out in the RFP.



    However, it will be necessary to establish some ground rules.     In the event the Operating Company (OC) wishes  to secure a market price for their insurance:

    1.  The OC may nominate a broker to secure pricing.  The Broker is subject to CRM's (Corporate Risk Management working for EGS-Enron Global Services)   approval.  Such approval will not be unreasonably withheld.   An appeal of an adverse decision from CRM to the CEO of EGS is possible.

    2.  CRM will specify and the operating company will supply to CRM,  the necessary underwriting information.

    3.  The OC will specify the types of insurance and coverages,  limits, and deductibles they require for their business.

    4.  CRM will provide the underwriting data and coverage specifications to the competing brokers.

    5.  The competing brokers will be directed by and report to CRM during the bid process and thereafter, if the broker is appointed.

    6.  CRM will receive the proposals from the brokers, evaluate and report the results, with recommendations, to the operating company and the appropriate senior     manager within Enron.

    7.  OC will elect the program and price they  prefer and CRM will have the right to provide such coverage or direct the appropriate broker in the placement of a    separate program.

    8.  For locations outside the U.S. the OC may request using their nominated broker for servicing their day to day insurance needs, provided the broker becomes  a correspondent within the established Enron Broker Network.  This will ensure continued co-ordination of the insurance programs.



    I think a progam like this can get everyone closer to a satisfactory conclusion in the process.     Please let me know your thoughts on the proposed program,   because obviously we need to get started ASAP.

Because TW owns most of the existing facilities and NNG owns only a tap valve.  TW should own all of the new facilities, but the NNG tap valve.  This way the new and old installation will accommodate the abandonment that is planned for next year at the existing site.  We had worked this through the law group earlier that TW would own.

Tracy,



I spoke with Fred and we have a resource available to assists with the remaining ETS modeling and development.  Dymetrix can be here this Wednesday and will be dedicated to ETS through the end of the year.  He will be responsible for the completion of the O&M model for home office.  He will also be responsible for the Marketing initiative.  



I spoke to Ben Humann about Omaha's resource needs.  They will require a resource for two weeks starting November 12th to implement the O&M contributor model.  If they should decide to move forward with development of a full financial system, they will require an additional six weeks of time at a minimum.  We will scope their financial system requirements during the initial two weeks to better determine what the actual recourse requirements will be.



As we discussed this morning I will be dedicated to ETS through the end of January.  I will address the remain issues with Operations.  I address data transfer issues between Adaytum and the Data Warehouse.  I will assist with and manage all of the above initiatives.



Please feel free to contact me if you have and questions or concerns.



#sig#Thanks

Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday.

 

I'm not real certain of the project organization, but I'll give it a try:

 

The Adaytum implementation is a corporate project managed under the Project Sunrise umbrella.  Joe Darensburg is the lead reporting to Jan Johnson.  Both of these people are originally from corp accounting.  I believe Jan has moved back into the corp accounting group and the overall project is now reporting to Susan Bellinghausen from the ISC.

 

ETS has it's own project which is being led by Tracy Geaccone (ETS Consolidations, which reports to Rod Hayslett).  I believe this was originally set up to address ETS' specific planning/forecasting needs and to dovetail into the corp level implementation.  Hoang Vo is an Adaytum consultant working for Tracy.

 

Lee Baker manages planning and forecasting for the Operations Services Group, which reports to Elaine Concklin and is part of Morris Brassfield's organization.  I believe Elaine has a dotted line to Rod as well.  Lee's team uses Hoang quite a bit as well.

 

I'll call you in a few minutes and we can discuss further.

Thanks for meeting this morning and developing a plan that that will accommodate the needs of the different groups within ETS.  As we begin to use Adaytum I believe we will see other areas where it will benefit ETS and EGS as well as opportunities for enhancements within our existing models.



#sig#Thanks again.

Re:  Dealing with today's uncertain business climate:  How using LRSolutions will help your legal department reduce outside counsel fees, increase legal knowledge and expertise in-house and save countless hours of time for busy in-house attorneys



As you are well aware, legal research and related knowledge activities and products are traditionally not a great source of efficiency and expertise. In-house counsel are frequently asked to provide their companies legal advice in a vast array of legal areas.  With corporate downsizing, understaffed legal departments are usually not equipped to deal with the many complex and varied legal issues that are presented on a daily basis.  Time is precious, as well, and in-house attorneys consistently find themselves hard pressed to attack these difficult legal problems with the degree of care required for thorough research and analysis.



Traditionally, corporate counsel respond by utilizing outside law firms for many research and writing projects that could have been done internally if only they possessed the knowledge, resources, and time.  Too often, these practices involve an inordinate amount of reinventing the wheel, leading to inefficiency and burdensome expense.  Outside counsel bill at exorbitant hourly rates while utilizing inexperienced, junior associates.  The subsequent learning curve only adds to the enormous costs for corporate counsel.  Because associates lack knowledge in the fields that they research, the total number of hours that they spend tend to be excessive.  With soaring associate rates, the ultimate price for corporate counsel often reaches the upper stratosphere.  At the same time, associates are likely to miss subtle nuances in the law that can be damaging to the client.  In today's economy, it is absolutely essential for companies to reduce outside legal costs while retaining qu!

al!

ity and value.  In addition to saving costs, companies must be able to effectively manage risk in a proactive fashion, in order to avoid potential disaster.



LRSolutions is structured to maximize efficiency, value and quality. Experienced, in-house, partner-level attorneys actively manage all research -related projects, and are always available to discuss your concerns.  LRSolutions' attorneys truly enjoy doing research, and analyzing complex legal issues.  In addition, we work with our network of legal experts that include hundreds of the nation's premier law professors and other distinguished attorneys organized intuitively into areas of specialty. Only experts in the field can produce a product in the most efficient manner, without 

missing crucial issues and predict ultimate cost.  Now, for a predetermined, fixed price, you can combine legal expertise with enormous cost savings.  Please see http://www.lrsolutions.com.



Our products and formats are flexible, and include multi-state surveys, detailed research memoranda on specific, complex issues, summations of law, advocacy materials such as appellate briefs and court filings, regulatory handbooks and manuals in every conceivable area of law (enabling your company to better manage risk and raise legal awareness), contract and other document drafting, settlement packages, and listings of relevant authorities.  We will always work with you to determine the format and objective that best suits your needs.  We can work with your outside counsel as part of your overall legal team, or provide an alternative to utilization of outside counsel as well as support for in-house projects.



If you would like to contact me by phone, please feel free to call at 1-800-627-8047, ext. 1.  Again, our website is http://www.lrsolutions.com.  Please also feel free to reply via email as well.  I am convinced that LRSolutions will be a critical and welcome long-term resource for your legal department as you attempt to deal with today's uncertain business climate, and I greatly look forward to speaking with you.

Please find attached the preliminary 2002 EREC earnings and cash flow plans.  This is a preliminary draft only.  As discussed with Tod, the operating cost line has been adjusted at a summary level to achieve the IBIT target agreed to during Friday's review with Stan Horton.

FP = fator de pondera??o aplic?vel ao montante de prote??o do ativo

subjacente;

PRA = prazo remanescente do ativo subjacente (em dias ?teis);

PRP = prazo remanescente do derivativo de cr?dito (em dias ?teis);

subjacente, conforme a Tabela de Classifica??o dos Ativos de que trata o

art. 2?, ? 1?, do Regulamento Anexo IV ? Resolu??o 2.099, de 1994, e

altera??es posteriores;

F = zero nas hip?teses do derivativo de cr?dito ser contratado na mesma

moeda que o ativo subjacente;

contratado em outra moeda que n?o a do ativo subjacente.

? 3? A exposi??o ao risco do ativo subjacente que exceder o montante

de prote??o deve ser ponderada pelo seu fator original conforme a Tabela de

Classifica??o dos Ativos de que trata o art. 2?, ? 1?, do Regulamento Anexo

IV ? Resolu??o 2.099, de 1994, e altera??es posteriores.

? 4? Na hip?tese em que estipulada cl?usula relativa a valores ou

percentuais m?nimos de perda do ativo subjacente para que a recomposi??o,

total ou parcial, seja efetuada, deve ser comprovada parcela adicional de

PLE equivalente ao valor ou percentual m?nimo estipulado.

Art. 4? A contraparte receptora do risco fica exposta ao risco de cr?dito do

ativo subjacente na propor??o do risco assumido.

Par?grafo ?nico. Na hip?tese de a contraparte receptora do risco

garantir o contrato de derivativo de cr?dito com a utiliza??o de recursos em

esp?cie ou de t?tulos de emiss?o de terceiros, a exposi??o ao risco

decorrente deve ser ponderada pelo maior fator de pondera??o entre aquele

aplic?vel ao ativo subjacente ao contrato de derivativo de cr?dito e aquele

aplic?vel ? contraparte transferidora do risco.

Art. 5? ? obrigat?ria a divulga??o, em notas explicativas ?s demonstra??es

Art. 6? O Banco Central do Brasil poder? determinar o aumento do PLE, com

base em caracter?sticas intr?nsecas ao contrato.

Tracy,

I need to know what the consolidated to Enron numbers are for ETS, PGG, and the other portions of Stan's world (if material), accrual-wise.  I'm not so concerned with the cash, but the EBIT impact bottom line to ENE.  Also, I need to know what part has been accrued YTD and how much more will be accrued in the 4th Q.

#sig#Thanks
We have just obtained from the court the citation that we need to serve on MSN.  We now have to take it to Austin to serve on MSN's registered agent.  Because of the time of day, we will not be able to do it today.  I have instructed the process server to go to Austin and serve it first thing in the morning.  Once that happens, I will let you know and we can give MSN a call.  Until then, no mention of the lawsuit.



As I said before, as negotiations proceed, please let me know if any commercial reason arises such that you believe service should be delayed.

Please review the attached agreement for the Big Sandy Interconnect.  It is very standard.  It is reimbursable.  It has a few blanks that have to be filled in for certain dates that we (or Caithness) don't know just at this time with respect to receiving regulatory approval, in-service date, etc.  Caithness wants this agreement for their prospective equity partners to review for content.  



Teb, Lee and Ron, this agreement has not changed since you have last seen it, but I just wanted you to give it one more look.





I would like to email to Kirk (Caithness) tomorrow afternoon.

Hi guys,

 

When I was down several weeks ago, you guys indicated that a few more golf

Let me know how many, what sizes, and black or white?

 

I can send some more your way.

FASB Adds Performance Reporting Project, Defers Intangible Assets Disclosure

Decision 

BNA - October 25, 2001



NORWALK, Conn.--The Financial Accounting Standards Board Oct. 24 formally

added a project on performance reporting to its rulemaking agenda, but it

deferred a decision on whether to start a separate standard-setting effort

on disclosures about intangible assets.  The topic of intangibles was the

subject of extended debate among FASB's seven members as they weighed its

importance in allocating staff resources to such a project or to two other

issues vying for the attention of rulemakers. 



FASB heard arguments from one board member, John Wulff, suggesting that an

effort to simplify and codify standards and other guidance that form

statements of generally accepted principles, together with writing standards

on revenue recognition and defining liability, may be more suitable

candidates for rulemaking.  Major U.S. corporations, through at least one

trade group, the Institute of Management Accountants, counseled the course

described by Wulff, a former leader of Financial Executive International's

Committee on Corporate Reporting. That committee opposes FASB's taking on

the performance reporting and intangibles projects as outlined in a

prospectus issued about two months ago. 



FASB settled on a compromise plan offered by board Chairman Edmund Jenkins.

In the compromise, the panel's staff will carry out further preparatory work

on intangible assets. At the same time, FASB's staff will study the three

potential projects--revenue recognition and liability definition,

simplification and codification of accounting rules, and disclosures about

intangibles--with an eye toward deciding an appropriate use of staff

accountants' time.  The additional work on intangibles is to focus on

summarizing existing research on such non-concrete assets as in-process

research and development, patents, and customer lists, with particular focus

on questions about what information on intangibles is useful to investors,

security analysts, and other users of financial statements. FASB would not

carry out polling or surveys, the board emphasized.  The board tentatively

set a deadline of Dec. 24 for completion of the two-pronged work by its

staff. That timetable would suggest FASB plans to make a more definitive

decision on adding a second, or even a third, standard-setting project in

early 2002.  



'Minimum Approach' in Performance Reporting Effort

FASB's new rulemaking on performance reporting represents an effort to

improve and make more useful information displayed on all the basic

financial statements, both interim and annual. In such a display and

presentation project, the board would not address recognition and

measurement questions, according to a staff summary.  FASB's staff

recommended that the board stick close to what is known as the minimum

approach in the performance reporting project, said Ronald Bossio, a senior

staff project manager. Pursuing that approach was the avenue favored by most

of the board's constituents who expressed support for starting the

standard-setting effort. 



The minimum approach is described by FASB's staff as one that would have the

board explore whether certain line items, subtotals, and totals should be

defined in standards and required to be displayed in financial statements,

including interim statements.  Line items and amounts that would be

considered include those related to metrics commonly used by investors and

creditors in assessing financial performance, the staff continued in a

summary distributed at the board's Oct. 24 meeting. 



Favored less by constituents and not advocated so far by any board member in

preliminary discussions is a broader approach. Under that, FASB would

describe how key financial metrics--usually ratios or some other

indicator--should be calculated if they are presented in financial

statements. However, the methods of figuring such metrics would not be

required to be shown in the financial statements, according to the staff's

summary of the broader path. 



Gary Schieneman, a veteran security analyst who joined FASB in July, said he

supports taking on the project on performance reporting. He added, however,

I think it will be difficult to stick closely to the minimum approach.

Michael Crooch, a colleague on the board, said he, too, supports the

rulemaking effort, but voiced a concern that the effort may be a project

that has no bounds. This is one we have to watch with regard to scope.  The

International Accounting Standards Board has begun its own standard-setting

on performance reporting. That task is being carried out jointly with the

United Kingdom's Accounting Standards Board in an effort, in part, toward

helping ensure convergence of financial reporting rules around the world.

FASB plans to monitor the IASB-ASB joint project. 



Defining Simplification

Wulff, a former high-ranking financial executive at Union Carbide who joined

FASB with Schieneman, first raised the issue of perhaps taking on other

projects--revenue recognition and simplification--when he was asked to voice

a view on embarking on the performance reporting project.  what

simplification is came to a head in FASB's debate when Wulff, weighing the

intangible assets project, questioned moving ahead on that effort before

understanding how many staff resources would be used in writing standards on

disclosures about intangibles. 



Some in the community of financial statement preparers--generally U.S.

corporations and their trade groups--oppose FASB's taking on the performance

reporting and intangibles projects. Instead, they suggest the accounting

board should begin rulemaking on liability and revenue recognition and what

the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) labels FASB

Codification/Simplification.  FASB board members and IASB's liaison to the

U.S. board, James Leisenring, said they know what codification means. The

name signifies a collection of FASB's authoritative literature and GAAP in

general that should be collected in one comprehensive format, as IMA's

Financial Reporting Committee wrote in a Sept. 19 letter to the accounting

board. 



However, several board members and Leisenring, FASB's former vice chairman,

regarded arguments for simplification warily, as shown by their comments

Oct. 24.  I know what codification is, said Leisenring. I don't know what

simplification is. He and FASB members Neel Foster and Katherine Schipper

suggested they know what simplification could mean, but did not elaborate,

instead making veiled references to moves such as requiring full fair

value-based recognition of financial instruments in the income statement,

widely opposed by banks and corporations.



Simplification a Complicated Effort

I also know that isn't what they want, Leisenring said of advocates of a

simplification project. He suggested that, if such a project is anything

like IASB's current effort to improve existing international accounting

standards, simplification would prove not so simple--and would consume

hundreds of hours of staff time if it's a serious endeavor.  Foster

labeled arguments that FASB should begin a simplification effort an attempt

to tie this organization up for the next 20 years. 



Schipper, who alone objected to Jenkins's compromise on the intangibles

project, said the board should begin the rulemaking on disclosures about

intangibles immediately and proceed full speed ahead. 

Schipper cited the lack of comparability in current reporting on purchased

intangible assets, which are accounted for under FASB's new rules on

business combinations, and on intangibles that are internally generated. The

latter and their values often are not reflected at all in financial

statements, although they are said to be key drivers in the so-called new

economy. 



In-process research and development, which figured prominently in mergers

and acquisitions in the high technology sector, needs a very strong look,

she added.  Schipper, a former accounting professor at the University of

Chicago and Duke University, said of accounting for intangibles: This issue

has been studied up and down, left and right, ... from floor to ceiling.

You may think [the academic] research is stupid and misguided. I don't,

she said in urging a quick start on standard-setting.



Other Action by FASB

In other action at its Oct. 24 meeting, the board tentatively decided to: 



    *   reactivate its dormant project on costs associated with

activities stemming from disposal of a factory or other hard asset used in a

discontinued business operation and reconsider all of the guidance in Issue

No. 94-3 of FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force, Liability Recognition for

Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity,

including one-time employee termination benefits and other restructuring

costs; 



    *   issue draft rules in mid-November to rescind FASB Statement

No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, and to make

miscellaneous technical corrections, including non-substantive changes to

FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases, and amendments related to FASB

Statements No. 141, Business Combinations, and No. 142, Goodwill and Other

Intangible Assets; and 



    *   consider at an upcoming meeting plans to revive--and most

likely head in a different rulemaking direction than previously pursued--the

board's 20-year-old project on consolidations policy, or defining when an

affiliate of a company should be deemed a subsidiary and have its activities

included in the financial statements of the parent.



In previous incarnations of FASB, an accounting model based on control of an

entity did not garner enough support to advance to a final accounting

standard and was criticized strongly by FEI and others. The control-based

model departed from the traditional majority equity ownership model, which

several FASB members suggest is not followed in current practice despite its

standing as accounting gospel.





Railtrack, Swissair First Test of Europe's Default Swap Market

Bloomberg - October 2001

By Tom Kohn



Europe's $250 billion market for credit default swaps, a form of insurance

against companies missing their debt payments, is getting its first test as

Railtrack Plc and Swissair Group wrestle with insolvency. 



Credit default swaps let banks and other investors juggle the risk that a

bond or loan won't be paid back. The buyer of such protection pays an annual

premium, and the seller pays if there's a so-called credit event, such as a

company going bankrupt. 



``Railtrack is the bigger of the two tests to the overall market,'' said

Dale Lattanzio, head of structured credit trading at Merrill Lynch & Co.

``While the government said the bonds will be OK, under the terms of the

contract it triggered a credit event, and the credit derivatives market is

treating it'' as such. 



Britain's government seized control of Railtrack on Sunday to stop the owner

of the U.K.'s rail network going bankrupt. It would have debts of 700

million pounds ($1 billion) by December and 1.7 billion pounds by March,

government lawyer David Richards told the High Court. Railtrack owes

bondholders more than $2.2 billion. 



Swissair is seeking bankruptcy protection after running out of money Oct. 1.

Europe's seventh-biggest airline owes bondholders $2.6 billion. The

company's market value is currently $48 million, after its shares fell 97

percent this year. 



Settling Claims 



Default swaps traded for both companies, and were triggered by the

announcements. 



``We're going through the process of settling claims,'' said Lattanzio.

``There's a broad agreement in the London-based credit derivatives market,

and it's been fairly orderly with no market disruptions.'' 



Sellers of credit protection aren't likely to refuse to pay out on their

contracts, traders said. Still, because the companies' near-bankruptcies

sparked swap payments it will test the legal contracts on which the banks

rely. 



Credit derivative agreements depend on legal documents developed by the

International Swaps and Derivatives Association, which represents about 540

securities firms. Banks use ISDA contracts for credit default swaps to

ensure their agreements won't collapse if unexpected events occur. 



ISDA defines a credit event as ``bankruptcy, failure to pay, obligation

default, obligation acceleration, repudiation or moratorium, and

restructuring.'' 



``The likelihood is that the documentation should stand up,'' said Ruth

Ainslie, senior policy director at ISDA in New York. She said that depends

if banks used ISDA agreements and ``whether or not they have been radically

changed.'' ISDA has received legal opinions on Swiss and U.K. jurisdiction,

because ISDA contracts cover a ``very broad range'' of agreements, she said.





`Consternation' 



The U.K. government plans to transfer Railtrack's bonds into a new company,

rated at least ``BBB'' by Standard & Poor's and ``Baa2'' by Moody's.

Bondholders would get interest and be repaid when the debt matures at

``broadly'' the same terms, Transport Secretary Stephen Byers said this

week. 



``Initially there was consternation when Railtrack was put into

receivership,'' said Ned Swan, a partner and derivatives specialist at law

firm Simmons & Simmons. Still, ``it's a major company with major assets. It

was a surprise, but these things will be worked out.'' 



The Bank of England estimates the credit derivatives market has a face value

of about $1 trillion, with credit default swaps accounting for about half

the market. London trading accounts for ``just under'' half the market. Up

to 2,000 swaps on companies are traded, with 500 to 1,000 trading

``actively.'' the bank said in a June report. 



The central bank cited British Bankers' Association and U.S. government

figures as well as its own estimates. The U.S. Office for the Comptroller of

the Currency reported U.S. commercial banks had credit derivatives with a

face value of $351 billion at the end of the second quarter. 



U.K. securities watchdog the Financial Services Authority monitors the banks

trading credit default swaps, though doesn't regulate credit derivatives. 



``We don't regulate it as a product,'' said Karin Loudon, an FSA

spokeswoman. ``It's up to the banks to manage their own legal risk.'' 



UBS AG sued Deutsche Bank AG for $10 million at Britain's high court in

March for failing to pay on a default swap when Armstrong World Industries

Inc., the U.S.'s biggest vinyl-flooring maker, defaulted on its debt. 



The dispute centered on Armstrong's name, because the contract referred to

its parent company, Armstrong Holdings Inc., according to the court filing.

The two banks settled the suit March 15. An FSA spokesman said at the time

that regulators don't typically intervene in such cases because banks

usually resolve disputes among themselves. 





Canada Publishes Final Regulations To Implement Financial Services Framework



BNA - October 25, 2001



OTTAWA--The Canadian government has implemented new framework legislation

for the financial services sector, including domestic and foreign banks,

trust companies, insurance companies, credit unions and other financial

institutions, Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions)

James Peterson said Oct. 24. 



Implementation of Bill C-8, An Act to establish the Financial Consumer

Agency of Canada and to amend certain Acts in relation to financial

institutions, coincides with the publication of a finalized package of

regulations necessary to give effect to the legislation's provisions,

Peterson said in a statement. 



The measures contained in Bill C-8 will help to ensure that the Canadian

financial services sector continues to be among the safest and most

accessible in the world, he said. The legislation will promote efficiency

and growth in the sector, foster international competitiveness and domestic

competition, empower and protect consumers of financial services, and

improve the regulatory environment. 



The legislation also creates the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, which

begins operations Oct. 24 and will enforce compliance with the legislation's

consumer provisions and educate consumers on how the legislation benefits

them, he said. The new agency has been in the public spotlight recently as a

necessary element of the federal government's efforts to track down and

freeze assets in Canada of international terrorist organizations. 



The Department of Finance published the finalized package of 75 regulations

in the Oct. 24, 2001 issue of the Canada Gazette, Part II. The regulations

are particularly important because a key element of the new financial

framework is the use of regulations to provide a more flexible regulatory

environment for the financial sector, said a regulatory impact analysis

statement published with the finalized regulations. 



This allows the government to make modest policy adjustments to the

framework in response to significant changes taking place in the global

environment in which financial institutions operate. Many regulations are

being proposed or modified in order to achieve this policy objective of

creating a more flexible regulatory regime, the impact analysis statement

said. 



The current proposals are the first of several packages of regulations that

will be brought forward to implement the policy intent of the new Act, and

will include regulations essential to operation of the legislation, it said.





Of the 75 regulations, 37 relate to the new framework's restructuring of the

permitted investment regime, while 18 are related to the new holding company

regime for financial institutions, six relate to creation of the new

Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, six relate to changes to the foreign

bank regime and the remaining eight are aimed at various other policy

objectives, it said. 



Key areas of the regulations relate to the activities of banks include: 





    *   definition of aggregate financial exposure for banks

engaging in certain transactions with related parties that are not federally

regulated financial institutions; 



    *   limits on the commercial lending activities of financial

institutions other than banks; 



    *   requirements for financial institutions to inform customers

with a complaint about a product or service on how to contact the Financial

Consumer Agency of Canada; 



    *   exemption of certain classes of entities from the status of

being an entity associated with a foreign bank and exemption of certain

classes of entities from the definition of foreign bank; 



    *   definition of the term equity when used in dealing with

ownership rules for banks and demutualized insurance companies; 



    *   rules on the investment powers of entities in which a

financial institution holds more than 10 percent of the voting shares or 25

percent of the equity, but not control; 



    *   definition of financial leasing; 



    *   prescription of a range of information-processing activities

permitted for banks and authorized foreign banks, including payroll

processing, clearing and management of deposit accounts; 



    *   prescribed limits for the amounts of real property and

equity investments permitted for financial institutions; 



    *   rules governing the ability of an entity to identify itself

as a member of a group in describing its corporate relationship with a

foreign bank; 



    *   prohibitions that apply to a foreign bank's real property

activities outside of its authorized foreign bank branch; 



    *   rules governing the content of a prospectus; 



    *   expansion of the scope of commercial companies in which

financial institutions are permitted to invest, subject to a number of

constraints and caps; and 



    *   provisions permitting regulated securities entities to hold

shares of a parent bank holding company to a limit of one percent of the

bank holding company's regulatory capital.



End Of Cantor Treasurys Quotes On Telerate Causes Bother

Dow Jones - October 25, 2001

TOKYO -- Some Japanese institutional investors were a little peeved Thursday

when information provider Telerate stopped offering Treasurys' pricing from

major inter-dealer broker Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, but the change

hasn't hampered trading of U.S. government debt, said Tokyo traders.



Telerate, owned by Moneyline, stopped posting Cantor Fitzgerald real-time

U.S. Treasury bond pricing on its screens globally from 5:00 p.m. EDT

Wednesday. The information and data provider said it would replace the

service with price quotes from rival inter-dealer broker BrokerTec Global

LLC. But as of 0700 GMT (3:00 a.m. EDT Thursday) the display remained blank.

The reason for the change wasn't immediately clear.

Investors have called in to say it's inconvenient that they can't check the

Cantor page (on Telerate) and have asked about prices, said a foreign

securities house trader in Tokyo. They are now logging onto the Cantor's

website or having to set up a Cantor page on a Bloomberg terminal.



Apart from a bit of hassle suffered by some investors, however, impact on

trading was limited.

Even with comprehensive on-screen price data investors will typically phone

up several brokerages to get bond price quotes before deciding to trade,

said a trader at a large Japanese insurance company. Losing access to price

indications wouldn't change that practice, he added.



Brokerage and bank Treasurys dealers, and their colleagues in the swaps

market, were unaffected as apparently none of them rely solely on the

Telerate service for U.S. debt security pricing information, traders said.

Telerate continues to provide limited non real-time U.S. government bond

pricing data from Cantor Fitzgerald and other brokers on a separate display.





The Case for Catastrophe Bonds

The New York Times - October 25, 2001

By Hal R. Varian



The insurance industry faces claims of at least $40 billion tied to the

World Trade Center attacks, and it remains exposed to significant risk from

future incidents. Retail insurance companies are considering exclusions for

terrorist damage, leaving property owners unable to buy the coverage they

need.



The problem lies in the reinsurance industry, the wholesale market where

insurers lay off large risks to pools of investors willing to absorb them.

Warren E. Buffett's reinsurance company, General Re, has done well in the

last few years offering property reinsurance because there have not been

major hurricanes or earthquakes. But its luck ran out last month: General Re

has said it is liable for over $2 billion of the total industry losses in

the Sept. 11 attacks.



Earthquakes and hurricanes, unpleasant as they are, present manageable

risks: insurers know roughly how often they occur in various places, what

their likely magnitudes are and how much property damage might be expected.



Terrorist risk is much harder to quantify, leading to the current paralysis

in the reinsurance market. The insurance industry has been lobbying in

Washington to make the federal government the insurer of last resort against

terrorism, which means that taxpayers will end up bearing the financial risk

of future attacks.



Britain adopted a government-backed reinsurance market several years ago

and, so far, it has worked reasonably well. But there is another way to

supplement traditional reinsurance markets that has been attracting

increasing attention: catastrophe bonds. These bonds, generally sold to

large institutions, have typically been tied to natural disasters, like

earthquakes or hurricanes, but they could, in principle, be used to provide

financial backing for terrorism insurance.



Here is how they work. A financial intermediary, like a reinsurance company

or an investment bank, issues a bond tied to a particular insurable event,

like a Los Angeles earthquake. If there is no earthquake, investors are paid

a generous interest rate. But if the earthquake occurs and the claims exceed

an amount specified in the bond, investors sacrifice their principal and

interest.



How generous does the interest rate have to be? That is left up to the

market. If the bond sales offer cheaper reinsurance coverage than do

traditional private placements used in the reinsurance market, these bonds,

known as cat bonds, are a preferred method of finance.



Cat bonds are a form of contingent security, a concept first formulated by

Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford University, winner of the 1972 Nobel in

economic science. 



Back in 1952, Professor Arrow came up with the idea of a security that would

pay a fixed amount of money depending on whether or not some event occurred.

He showed that portfolios of such contingent securities could be used to

allocate virtually any kind of risk in an efficient manner.



The analysis by Professor Arrow was long thought to be of only theoretical

interest. But it turned out that all sorts of options and other derivatives

could be best understood using contingent securities. Now Wall Street rocket

scientists draw on this 50-year-old work when creating exotic new

derivatives.



There are a number of special cases of contingent securities. Consider a

security tied to my house burning down. This would certainly affect my net

worth, but would have negligible impact on the owners of the other 70

million housing units in the United States.



This kind of personal risk can easily be shared among many people, each

paying only a small amount if the event occurs, and homeowners insurance is

to ease this kind of risk sharing.



This works fine for small independent risks, but there are other sorts of

events that impose large costs on many people at the same time, like

earthquakes or hurricanes. Insurance companies are able to deal with such

events using reinsurance markets, where the risk is transferred to large

investors.



There are other financial institutions that also allow for risk transfer for

this sort of widespread risk. The orange juice futures market in Chicago is

essentially a market in a contingent security tied to whether it freezes in

Orlando, Fla.



A futures market allows market participants who bear a significant risk

(like farmers worried that their crop might be destroyed) to transfer some

of that risk to others, who are, of course, paid to absorb it. The futures

market allows shifting of risk rather than a simple sharing of risk.



Risk sharing and risk shifting are familiar terms, but there is another

phenomenon worth noting, something I like to call risk shafting. This is

when some risk - often a particularly large risk - is transferred to a third

party who is forced to bear it involuntarily.



In many cases, these third parties are taxpayers, who are not even aware of

their potential liability.



Hence the debate that is going on in Washington now: should the insurance

industry be able to transfer the risk from future terrorist attacks to

taxpayers? Or would it be better to use existing reinsurance markets or new

financial instruments like catastrophe bonds to shift the risk to those

willing and able to bear it if appropriately compensated?



Cat bonds have some attractive features. They can spread risks widely and

can be subdivided indefinitely, allowing each investor to bear only a small

part of the risk. The money backing up the insurance is paid in advance, so

there is no default risk to the insured.



As the market for cat bonds matures, secondary markets may develop,

particularly if the bonds become standardized and bundled into portfolios.

If so, the market price of cat bonds will reflect the market perceptions of

the likelihood of the event associated with the bond, just as price changes

on the orange juice futures market reflect the likelihood of a freeze in

Florida.



The market for cat bonds is still immature, and is only a fraction of the

size of traditional reinsurance. But cat bonds and other sorts of contingent

securities may well end up being part of the long-run solution to the

problems of the reinsurance industry.

On tuesday of this week after EOTT's staff meeting, I was made aware of a potential environmental estimate problem (too big).    I am looking at ways of potentially dealing with the problem so that Lawrence will feel comfortable not booking a reserve in the 3rd qtr, which may have consequences on the plans we have underway to recapitalize the entity.   This means coming up with an answer very quickly.   There are a number of potential alternatives and I am sure there are more than I will attempt to lay out here.



1) We could simply make a contribution to EOTT for the sole purpose of environmental cleanup, and if unused will be returned.   Seems like an expense item, but doable.



2) We could provide an insurance policy to EOTT to provide for environmental expenses in excess of the existing policy, for a fee.    Better expense treatment (we get to manage the reserve) and appears to cover the EOTT issue.   Because this is an affiliated deal, I guess it would have to go through the audit committee.   Potentially the captive could be used.



3) Provide an accounting answer that might give EOTT a one-time gain to offset the one time reserve set-up.   i.e., there is a least an argument that the recapitalization proposed will result in the extinguishment of a portion of the debt on the books represented by the API's.     Since we are getting a conversion of less than a dollar for dollar deal, this should be doable.



For Lawrence:  Jim Bouillion has indicated that the insurance proposal may have merit, and so I will need some input from you regarding the coverage that exists now and what we would want going forward.    If you want us to talk directly with Susan, we will.   I am thinking that you are getting a quote for increasing the cap on the existing policy and that we could give you the same deal, or maybe even slightly better, to satisfy the audit committee.  



I am obviously looking for any help that I can get here, so if there any more ideas I would like to hear them.    If you have questions, feel free to ask.    Stan is aware of what we are discussing.   1) and 3) were his requests to review.

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.



I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.



We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.



While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.



I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

There are still open issues on both the NNG and TW credit facilities--but the goal is to have the TW credit agreement signed sometime today and get it funded by Wednesday, while NNG will probably close later in the week -- likely Friday--once the Dynegy issues are melded with those of the bank.

After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  



I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called PACE, and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  



Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  



The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.



New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.



I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

Attached is a file that Cheryl and I developed concerning the Corporate MMF and Direct Charges budget that we have received to date.  We have to send out a partnership budget on Monday, October 1 and would like to get a good handle on which of these charges will be eliminated or reduced substantially at the Friday meeting.  Since we are unsure of the benefit that many of these charges provide to us, it is doubtful that the partnership would approve all of these increases so we don't want to send out a budget that has them in it.  



It is our understanding that you want our questions directed to your group so that you can address corporate planning yourselves.  Please let us know if you need any additional clarification about our questions.

The attached file has July 2001 and September 2001 analyzed.



I have compared the TW Balance Report to Actuals for July 2001 (see attached spreadsheet) and feel that the Fuel Retention numbers are good.  The Fuel Burned numbers are generally too low due to missing 3-days of actuals and some fuel meters are inputted only once a month and will be missing from the balance report.  However, when you use Ken's report just estimate the fuel numbers 25% higher and you will be OK.



The remaining volumes (Retention less Fuel less Sales) will equal imbalances and UAF.  Ken's report (area under construction) needs work to solve the imbalance question and we can discuss this next week.  He will be in Houston Monday and Tuesday.



Also, I want to make one thing clear.  Sales go to the bottom line, however if your selling imbalance gas received from a customer or line pack you will have an expense offset that also goes to the bottom line.   Conversely, if you are repaying (giving) gas to a customer you will have an expense credit that goes to the bottom line.  Over-retained gas (Retention less Fuel less UAF) is the only bottom line amount.  You can sell the gas outright or sell it to the customers imbalance or linepack.  If you sell it to linepack or volume valued imbalances, you will have taken on commodity risk.  We can discuss TW's risk profile next week.

ISDA PRESS REPORT - NOVEMBER 12, 2001

RISK MANAGEMENT

ISDA survey reveals strong upward trend

IFR - November 10, 2001



The global notional outstanding volume of credit derivatives transactions

hit US$631.497bn for the first half of 2001, according to the International

Swaps and Derivatives Association's first survey of credit derivatives

transactions. While still modest in relation to interest rate products,

this figure is expected to remain on a strong upward trend compared to more

mature derivative product areas, ISDA said.



ISDA surveyed total notional outstanding volumes for single name credit

default swaps, default swaps on baskets of up to 10 credits, and portfolio

transactions of 10 credits and more. Eighty-three member firms supplied data

for the survey.



Interest rate and currency derivatives growth clocked in at just above 3.5%

in the first half of the year among members that also reported at year-end

2000, ISDA said. For these firms, total notional outstanding volumes

increased to about US$55.2trn from roughly US$53.3trn.



Total notional principal of interest rate swaps, interest rate options and

currency swaps for all surveyed firms slid to US$57.3trn from US$G3trn at

year-end last year. Among the top 10 dealers, a minor decrease in volume

from US$35.6trn to US$35.Strn was recorded, ISDA noted.



According to Thomas Montag, chair of ISDA's market survey committee, the

shifting product use reflected greater uncertainty in the global market

environment. The market for credit protection has an obvious appeal during

times of economic downturn, he added.



ISDA's survey is compiled twice a year by Andersen. Sixty-seven of the 83

member firms that participated in this survey also participated in the

previous survey.





ISDA's new supplement includes converts in default swaps

Dow Jones - November 12, 2001

By Joe Niedzielski



NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The International Swaps and Derivatives Association

has published a supplement to its 1999 document for credit derivatives which

incorporates convertible bonds and zero-coupon bonds, among others, as

deliverable securities in these contracts. 



The trade group said late Friday that it had finalized and published its

Supplement Relating to Convertible, Exchangeable or Accreting Obligations.



The supplement addresses the treatment under the 1999 ISDA Credit

Derivatives Definition of certain types of convertible and exchangeable

obligations, as well as the treatment of accreting obligations, such as

zero-coupon bonds, low coupon bonds issued at a discount and non-discounted

bonds that accrete during their term, ISDA said. 



The Convertibles Supplement represents the consensus of a diverse range of

constituents in the credit derivatives markets, including portfolio

managers, credit protection sellers and dealers, said Robert G. Pickel,

ISDA's executive director and CEO. 



Credit default swaps allow buyers to transfer the risk of a default on

obligations like bonds or loans, or other types of credit events like a debt

restructuring. They have had a growing influence in the broader fixed-income

universe, at times playing a role in the pricing of corporate bonds. 



And some convertible-bond investors will lay off the credit risk from the

fixed-income portion of a convertible security by buying credit default swap

protection. 



ISDA's supplement was expected. A group of U.S.-based dealers submitted a

proposal to ISDA a few months ago to include obligations like convertible

bonds as deliverable securities in these contracts. 



And in mid-October, ISDA told members that convertible bonds were

deliverable under standard credit derivatives contracts. The group's

memorandum to members came in response to questions from members following

the appointment of a railway administrator for Railtrack PLC (U.RTK). 



Holders of convertible bonds issued by Railtrack had complained that some

sellers of credit protection weren't paying claims on default swap contracts

on the Railtrack credit. 





The Basel perplex

The Economist - November 8, 2001



The arcane world of banking supervision is not usually the talk of German

chancellors on tours of Asia. Gerhard Schr?der made an exception recently

when he threatened that Germany would veto any new European directive based

on the latest proposals from the Basel committee of big-country bank

supervisors. In its present form, said Mr Schr?der in Bangalore, Basel 2 (as

the proposals are known) is unacceptable to Germany.



Basel 2 attempts to formulate more precisely than before the levels of

regulatory capital that banks must hold as a cushion against the credit

and other risks that they run. After more than three years of talks, the

Basel boffins have developed rules which are still not acceptable to

commercial banks. That is strange, since they are supposed to mirror the way

the world's most sophisticated banks themselves calculate their risks. The

whole exercise has shades of Heath Robinson about it.



The banks are up in arms, this week bearding the Basel committee for its

latest draft rules, which get ever more complicated and prescriptive. By the

time they are implemented, in 2005 at the earliest, the rules look likely to

burden banks with extra costs (ie, through the need to run parallel

reporting systems) and perverse incentives to game the system. Basel 2

could thus aggravate the very thing it set out to correct, a distortion of

financial markets.



Germany's grouse has to do with the Mittelstand, the 3m small and

medium-sized companies that are the economy's backbone. The Basel 2 formulae

for credit risk are based on credit ratings applied to company debt, either

by rating agencies or internally by banks themselves. But few smaller

companies are rated in this way. Moreover, German companies are more than

usually dependent on medium-term bank loans, and the longer the loan the

more it is penalised under the proposals. 



The Germans-but also the Italians and the Japanese-fear that their

medium-sized companies will lose under the new capital regime. Many of the

2,800 German banks are not equipped to rate the companies to which they

lend: equipping them would drive up the cost of lending. German bank

associations plan to help by pooling credit data for their members. But Mr

Schr?der's advice to banks last week was that they should not be overhasty

in applying the new Basel principles ahead of time.



Already the committee is working on a fix. On November 5th it posted a

clutch of new suggestions on its website that included new risk weightings

for smaller companies, and proposals that physical collateral, receivables

and even leased assets be used to lessen a particular company's credit

charge. These were interim ideas, it said, which needed to be tested and

even revised.



All well and good. But the Basel committee is getting into knots trying to

address every objection as it arises. Each time, it seems, the committee

adds another layer of complexity for banks and their supervisors to master.

Most recently, after strident objections by banks, there was the shifting of

the w-factor (the possibly unquantifiable residual risk in a credit

derivative) from one supervisory category to another, and also the setting

of arbitrary minimum risk weights for unrated securitised assets. The figure

for operational risk (non-market risks such as the loss of data, a rogue

trader or the destruction of a bank's headquarters) has been slashed, after

objections from banks.



The November 5th pabulum came in response to a quantitative impact study

(a live study of how the proposed capital charges would affect a sample of

138 banks in 25 countries). The Basel committee has always said that the

scale of charges needs to be properly calibrated. In fact, it gave itself an

extra year to get the calibration right. It has invited some banks to take

part in a fresh impact study using its latest proposed adjustments.



The results should help the Basel committee to tweak its formulae to get

results. Its declared goal is not to increase or decrease the overall

capital charge imposed on the banking system, merely to allocate it more

efficiently.



But some regulators are worried that the more risk-sensitive the regime is,

the more reluctant banks will be to lend in a downturn, aggravating economic

cycles. There are attempts to fix this too. For example, Spain allows its

banks to make a provision at the inception of a loan-putting money aside for

a rainy day. Some countries need to fix their accounting regimes before they

can follow suit.



Regulators appear stoically optimistic that all these fixes will work, and

that a credible new framework will be established-not without flaws,

perhaps, but better than what exists today. The timetable may slip, but the

plan is to produce a final draft framework early next year, allowing

consultation until the end of March, which should result in a firm set of

rules by the end of 2002. That, in theory, still allows time for the

European Union to draft and finalise a matching directive on capital

adequacy for banks and financial firms, to be in force by January 2005.



With Basel 2, bank supervisors are trying to do three main things. They want

to devise formulae that bring capital charges closer to the banks' own

measures of risk. They want to establish continuous review of banks'

management, and especially of their risk management, as a factor in

adjusting the capital charge. And they want to create incentives for greater

public disclosure of banks' risk exposures. This is an attempt to let

markets take on more of a supervisory role. Yet, in reality, the supervisors

are becoming micro-managers.



A member of the Basel committee insists that most of the world's 36,000

banks will be governed by a regime no more complex than Basel 1, in force

today. The more sophisticated financial groups that aspire to a so-called

advanced approach will be treated differently. We'll be crawling all over

them initially, says the supervisor, because ultimately we're giving them

more freedom.



All the same, in between the lowest and the highest, thousands of banks will

be graduating from a standardised to a more sophisticated approach, with

heavy demands on supervisors' time. Only America and Britain already have a

culture of continuous review by supervisors. Most other regimes are either

less sophisticated, or they are hamstrung by non-adjustable capital charges

that are set at a minimum by law.



Then there is the Brussels hurdle. Whatever the Basel committee decides

works for banks must be applied in the European Union to all investment

firms, including broker-dealers and asset managers. The scope is huge for

further descent into mind-boggling detail. Supervisors and financial firms

may well end up thanking Mr Schr?der if he vetoed the lot.





Supervisors review cross-sectoral practice

IFR - November 10, 2001



The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Organisation

of Securities Commissions and the International Association of Insurance

Supervisors last week released, under the banner of the Joint Forum, two

reports comparing risk management practices and principles in the sectors

they supervise.



Both reports were principally aimed at the supervision of conglomerates that

incorporate businesses in banking, securities and insurance, but one also

took a close look at risk transfer practices.



The first report, Risk Management Practices and Regulatory Capital, compared

the approaches in each sector in an effort to gain a better understanding

of current industry practices in all three sectors. The main sections of

the report focus on: differences in core business activities, similarities

and differences in risk management tools, approaches to capital regulation

in the three sectors and cross-sectoral risk transfers and investments.



It is in relation to the latter two sections that the report provided what

some may regard as its sting. The Joint Forum suggested that as supervisors

evaluate the extent of cross-sectoral activity, in terms of risk transfer

using derivatives, securitisation and other techniques: It may become

important for the individual sectoral frameworks to be updated to better

reflect the contemporary risk profiles of the firms subject to those

frameworks. It would not be surprising, for example, for some jurisdictions

in the near future to consider greater convergence in the frameworks applied

to the different sectors.



The report explained that supervisors should consider the potential for

existing capital regulations to provide incentives for capital arbitrage.

To the extent that some firms are engaging in activities that are not

addressed through capital requirements, supervisors need to ensure that

other measures are in place to ensure that the associated risks are being

appropriately managed and are supported by sufficient economic capital, it

added.



As a result, the report said, supervisors should continue to evaluate

approaches that could be taken to address crosssectoral investments within

the various capital frameworks.  The second report, Core Principles,

compared the core principles each supervisor has issued to its respective

sector as risk management guidelines.



The Joint Forum found that each set of core principles provided an overview

of the essential elements of the supervisory regime in that sector at the

time they were written (1997-2000).  However, the pace of developments in

the financial sector since then has required consideration of the need to

keep the core principles updated.  The report found no evidence of

underlying conflict or contradiction between the three sets of core

principles at the highest levels. However, in some cases there are

significant differences in the application of similar principles.

MD Anderson has approximately 500 job openings, some of which may be suitable for former Enron employees.  The jobs vary but include a number of IT and administrative positions.  



MD Anderson's potential interest in employing laid off Enron employees came to our attention via Anne Marie Giltrop of MD Anderson who spoke with Angela Davis.  This morning, I spoke with Ms. Giltrop.  In light of our policy of only providing neutral references and other liability considerations, I stated that I did not believe we would provide MD Anderson a list of employees who were laid off, but that I would try to find an approved vehicle for getting information regarding job openings at MD Anderson to our former employees.  The MD Anderson web site does not reflect all current open positions, so I suggested that, if approved on both ends, MD Anderson could provide a list of openings with job descriptions that could be made available to former Enron employees.  Ms. Giltrop is attempting to obtain appropriate approval from MD Anderson.  She later phoned to inform me that I should expect to hear more from Deborah Manning, Jim Dorn, or Martha Jones.  



On our end, I have contacted David Oxley who put me in touch with Cindy Olson.  Sarah Davis will now handle coordinating relations with MD Anderson.  This is an important opportunity for former employees, and for Enron and MD Anderson as good Houston citizens.  Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

Hi everyone.  I have yet another request for which I need your input.  Causey is reviewing his budgets/direct reports, and would like to get the most current headcount numbers for the accounting groups in your business unit(s).  



What I mean by accounting groups includes everyone whose superior ultimately reports to Causey.  For instance, this would include the traditional Accounting/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support departments.  It should NOT include any settlements/mid-office groups (for example, Sally Beck's world).  I say department because I don't want just accountants, but everyone who is in that dept, i.e. admins, clerks, etc.  If you have a question on any unique situation, please just give me a call and we'll discuss.



The data needs to be as recent as possible.  Hopefully, I can get this as of July 31/August 1.  If you have more recent data, that would be great.  At a bare minimum, I need total headcount as described by group (acct, reporting, tax, etc.)  It would also be useful to get as much detail as possible, i.e. by sub-group, by personnel level, etc., but I know that may be a challenge given the timing of the request.  



Additionally, if you can provide me with a current estimate for the groups you report, that would be ideal.  I know that the official CE doesn't go to that level, but I'm betting that most of you have something that projects your G&A by cost center (or group/dept) for 2001, as of the 2nd CE.



The headcount information is a must have, and the 2001 cost estimate is secondary, although I'd like to ask everyone to strive to provide both.  If you can't provide estimated costs for the groups you report, please call me so we can discuss.



Speaking of the timing, I need this by Wednesday, August 29 at 12 noon.  This will be given to Rick on Thursday morning, so I'll need some time to consolidate the data and to ask you all any further questions.



If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Tracy, I talked to the Colorado Sales and Use Tax auditor today.  The auditor will submit two assessments:  Assets and Compressor Fuel.  



Compressor fuel will be assessed, but I believe the following are plausible arguments that might succeed and favorably adjust the estimated $350,000 liability (Plus Penalty & Interest):



    (2)(b)(ii)  Purchase Price should be adjusted to reflect TWP as a market maker, that could purchase natural gas             lower than market could supply and transportation in San Juan Index

            (Price should be $1.80 / MMBTU down from Avg $1.90/ MMBTU)

       (b)(iii) The correct tax rate would be 3%, not 5%, local tax should not be applicable.  Formal research is required.





Assuming $1.80/MMBTU, the original estimate ($350k) might be adjusted down to $231,218.46, or as low as $138,731.08, as follows:



                 2,569,094  Consumption  MMBTU

               $        1.80    Price / MMBTU

               $4,624,369.20    Purchase 

                $92,487.38  Local Tax

                 $138,731.08    State Tax

                 $231,218.46    Total Tax



Please call if you would like to meet and discuss this issue.

(Account L80-30571) 







Tracy, I called the auditor last week, following our conversation.  The auditor has not returned my call.  Field work is complete and no formal assessment has been issued.  I have unresolved issues which the auditor must consider before issuing the assessment. In Summarizing our conversation last week:



1)  I have not seen a preliminary assessment, which I hoped would be coming in October.

2)  During the auditor's field audit, the auditor proposed to assess tax on the following issues:

    a)  Assets Purchase $500,000 in Tax, Penalty & Interest.  I might protest almost all assessed 

      amounts for this category.

    b)  Expenses (Compressor Fuel) Estimate $350,000 for audit Period.  Issues not resolved:

      i)    My position is that no tax is due, except for domestic fuel consumption.

      ii)   If Compressor Fuel is taxable, what is the Purchase Price.

      iii)  Is the 2% local tax applicable to Compressor Fuel?

      iv)   Should tax be calculated prospectively, rather than retroactively?

      v)    If assessed, Transwestern requests that the current regulation be revised to 

          reflect a change for this issue (Tariff may accommodate a pass through without

          a rate case?).



I will provide a copy of the assessment for your records and subsequent consideration, when available.  The auditor was promoted during my audit and is transition.  Considering this transition and my challenges, response time is unpredictable.

So, I can't tell what my exposure is here.  Which line do I use?

The maximum shown on the schedule is $1.1MM   (expand column width on Column A).   Although it looks from the spreadsheet as if $300 to $600K may be more realistic for the compressor fuel tax through 4/01.  However, there could be $11K/month going forward. 

The other issue would be the sales tax on our purchase of personal property from NWP.  Whatever that may turn out to be, it should not be an earnings concern, but would be capitalized as part of the plant.  

If you need more specificity, I suggest you give Dan a call.

John, I have prepared a more formal position regarding the exemption of Compressor Fuel consumed in a continuing business activity (Gas services).  Before I submit this position to you, I will circulate my position letter within the company and validate the facts.  

I will be relying primarily on Colorado Regulations 26-102.21 or 39-26-104.1(d.1).  Have these regulations changed recently?  My service may be out of date.

Attached below are schedules for Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption for the audit period.

    (Account L80-30571) Tour, Status and Protest





Dan,

Here is my initial response.  I haven't had time to do too much research on

this, but this preliminarily the Department's position.  Sorry this took so

long  but I am working on a bankruptcy case which has my first priority.  jp

If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing

accompanying the transfer of cash from Enron to Northwest Pipeline Corp., I

might agree.  But, the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash.

I don't believe that the statute and regulation support that position.

Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service

to qualify for the exemption.  I don't believe it does.  I definitely need

more research on this.



> PENALTY & INTEREST

The disposition of penalty and interest will be resolved at a level above the auditor level.

I am in Germany on Nov 1 but will call in.  Let me know what time Stan wants to do the dry run (I will be 7 hours ahead of Houston; it would be best for me if I could call after 8 pm German time).  I know we will only have 20 minutes with Ken per business unit.  After sitting through my presentation to Stan, I would appreciate your recommendations on what we should focus on for EREC.  Thanks.

I have not heard back on if you have corrected your reports.  Again I want to clarify that I am not using gross/net reports to prove to you that R112386 has a balance of only $64,720.92, I am using SAP cost center reports.  The only difference between the gross/ret report and the R cost centers is a $196.48 direct charge for computer expense to a FAR order.  This difference is detailed in the spreadsheet I have provided.  Are you still sure my R cost centers are over budget by $26,000?  They sure look under-budget by $23,000 to me.  Please let me know as I would like to submit an expense report.

I am not sure if it is premature and there is an obvious business interest on their part, but Blakes has called a number of times to see if they can be involved in any Canadian matters involving the merger process and approvals.  In fairness, Blakes is the firm that understands and represents our Canadian business the best, and a number of regulatory approvals may be required.  They apparently have cleared all conflicts.

What is the final decision on this reclass?  Does this affect an entire cost center or is it just dollars?  Is Accounting going to restate the Actuals and change the hierarchies?



Rositza, whatever we need to do, I want to do at a high level in our schedules, then pass back the changes to any coordinator who is affected.  All the Operations costs are coming from one person.

Subject:    La Plata to Bloomfield Drag Reducing Agent Application Proposal



I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.



The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.



Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:



2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30

2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31



I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.



Thanks for your help on this.

Attached is the revised calendar for the completion of the 2002 Plan.  As you will note, the dates have been moved up approximately 2 weeks in most cases.  This is a result of the recent management changes and executive availability.



A couple of notes on the dates:



-Please note that dates for assessments apply to ALL BUSINESS UNITS who will be senders of costs.

-The October 18th due date for the Presentation Pages: I will provide more information at a later date on this.

-The dates highlighted in yellow are not 2002 Plan related, but merely a reminder of other significant items that will be occurring in this time frame.



Also included in the file FYI is the PROPOSED schedule for the Plan/Executive Business Reviews with the Office of the Chairman.  These are still subject to change.  Rick Causey's office (Sharron Westbrook) is coordinating the schedules of the applicable attendees.  I will let you know when these are final.



Additionally, the Plan will be submitted to Corporate in the traditional format, Excel files.  We will be sending the templates out on (or by) September 20, as reflected in the revised calendar.  However, our strategy is still to enter 2002 with the full plan ( I/S, B/S, Cash Flow) loaded into Adaytum and to utilize Adaytum going forward from that point.  Therefore, we will be enhancing the Excel files to include the level of detail that will be loaded into Adaytum, so there will be additional lines and/or supplemental schedules added to the files.



One more thing - please communicate all of this information to the appropriate individuals in your business unit/group.



If you have any questions, please give me a call.



Thanks,

Subject:    La Plata to Bloomfield Drag Reducing Agent Application Proposal



I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.



The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.



Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:



2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30

2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31



I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Hello, following up our PGE Budget presentation I am forwarding you the

following information.



Jessica - the 2002 Capital Slide has been revised to be consistent with

the NNG disclosure schedule.  The decommissioning forecast is up by $1.6

MM, however since this is funded by the decommissioning trust it should

not be an issue.



Tracy - Do you have a time and agenda set for the Nov. 1 dry run of the

budget presentation?  I may be sitting in for Piro so please keep me

posted as to what the plan is.



Rod - you asked for some detail on our IT capital expenditures.  The

file IT_Teresa includes the requested detail.  Note that in our UE-115

ratecase we were authorized to expend up to $96.8 MM for the  2000-2002

budget years. This is a balancing account, such that if we don't expend

the money we have to refund it to customers.  As an fyi - I've pasted in

below the language from our UE-115 Stipulation on IT costs.





Q.  What is the basis for the stipulation relating to issue S-45, CIS /

IT Disallowance?



A.  After a Staff review of new IT systems and their associated capital

costs, Staff has determined PGE's capital costs for new IT systems to be

prudent.  As a result, the Parties agreed to full recovery of PGE's IT

investments, subject to a Staff audit.  PGE will place into base rates

100% of the 2002 revenue requirement related to the 2000, 2001, and 2002

capital additions for the CIS/IT capital items listed below.  The 2002

revenue requirement included in base rates will be trued-up to the

actual revenue requirement for the CIS/IT capital costs.  OPUC Staff

will audit PGE's actual capital expenditures for the CIS/IT capital

items listed below.



1. Customer information system.

2. Enterprise resources planning (ERP) system.

3. Network meter reading (NMR) backbone and data store (excluding the

meters).

4. Miscellaneous capitalized information technology costs.



Some of the forecasted 2000-2002 capital additions may be delayed until

2003.  Delayed costs can also be recovered, subject to the same Staff

audit procedures and standards.  Only those costs that are reasonable

and prudent will be authorized for inclusion in the actual revenue

requirement calculation.  Accordingly, customers will receive a refund

for any costs PGE does not expend or costs the OPUC finds imprudent.



Let me know if you have any questions.

I think that the BOE should be admitted to membership.



Also, Bob, about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), following the

recent seminar we did for them in HK, I think that we are likely to hear

more from them about membership. Frankly, it is easy for me to raise the

issue with David Carse/Simon Topping, which might well precipitate a formal

application, but obviously I would rather not do so without hearing further

from the Board about the potential success of such an application.



It is probably best if I write separately about the HKMA and its functions

including why membership for them might make sense. At that point, further

discussion would be useful.

 the message and any attachments may or may not be accurate.

******************************************************************



Shortly before the teleconference Board meeting two weeks ago we received

an

application from the Bank of England for subscriber membership. When we

have

considered central banks or government agencies for membership in the past,

consideration has focused on the nature of the applicant's derivatives

activities, its regulatory role and the type of information they are likely

to obtain from ISDA. Because of their derivatives activities, we have

generally admitted these applicants (e.g., the Kingdoms of Belgium, Denmark

and Sweden, the Reserve Banks of South Africa and New Zealand). We have

even

admitted the Bank for International Settlements as a member. In general, we

let them know that they may not be able to receive the full range of ISDA

materials (e.g., draft comment letters or position papers) and that there

may be a need to exclude them from certain committees or discussions.



In previous Board discussions, a higher degree of concern has been

expressed

if, theoretically, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of

England or similarly influential central banks were to apply for

membership.

These central banks typically have a greater degree of involvement in the

regulatory debates (particularly on capital) and are better positioned to

influence the process.



Since some of those previous debates, the regulatory role of the Bank of

England has diminished and the role of the Financial Services Authority has

correspondingly increased. The Bank of England still plays the traditional

central bank roles of controller of the money supply, dealing in the market

and lender of last resort, but the supervisory role has shifted to the FSA.



In light of these developments, but recognizing the concerns previously

expressed on central bank membership, I would appreciate your views on the

application of the Bank of England. We have also had overtures from the

Hong

Kong Monetary Authority regarding membership although we have not received

an application.



Please share your views with the other members of the Board.

Subject:  Credit Derivatives Issue





******************************************************************

 This message originated from the Internet. Its originator may or

 may not be who they claim to be and the information contained in

 the message and any attachments may or may not be accurate.

******************************************************************



You should be aware that an issue is currently under extensive debate in

the

credit derivative area resulting from the insolvency of Railtrack in the

UK.

ISDA has been asked by some participants in the market to make a statement

regarding a provision of its Credit Derivatives Definitions. Others are

either still considering their position or would prefer that ISDA not issue

a statement.



Specifically, the discussion relates to the deliverability of convertible

bonds of Railtrack. There is no dispute that a Credit Event occurred. What

is in dispute is whether the bonds satisfy the definition of Not

Contingent under the Definitions, which is a characteristic typically

required of deliverable obligations. This characteristic requires that the

payment or repayment of principal on the bonds not be subject to a

contingency. The bonds are convertible into equity of Railtrack at the

option of the holder or, in certain limited circumstances, at the option of

the trustee for the bondholder. The provision for the trustee to exercise

the conversion (sometimes referred to as a widows and orphans clause) is

a

standard clause in bonds issued in England and is intended to protect

bondholders who may have inadvertently failed to exercise their conversion

right when it would be clearly beneficial economically for them to do so.

In

the case of Railtrack, conversion would not have been economically

beneficial at any time recently, but nevertheless the right of the trustee

to convert exists.



A draft statement has been prepared for consideration by the Credit

Derivatives Market Practice Committee, which I have attached for your

review. The statement refers to two documents that are in draft form, the

User's Guide to the Definitions (which is scheduled to be published in the

next week or two) and a Supplement currently under consideration by the

group of six subgroup of the Committee. In each of these documents, we

suggest that plain vanilla convertible bonds should satisfy the Not

Contingent characteristic and should, therefore, be deliverable. Plain

vanilla convertible bonds for this purpose include bonds where conversion

is at the option of the holder of the trustee.



A meeting of a number of dealers based in London (not an ISDA meeting) is

scheduled for Tuesday. It is not likely that we will publish anything prior

to that meeting.



I would appreciate your views on whether we should issue any statement

regarding this situation. We are continuing to poll members for their views

on whether this type of market statement would be appropriate. We are also

discussing with Allen & Overy and with Clifford Chance and Linklaters how

we

might achieve a legal basis for making the statement. Please share your

views with the other addressees of this email, as they are coordinating the

views of members.

TRADING PRACTICE

Pricing Synthetic CDO's

Derivatives Week - October 29, 2001



Traditionally collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) involve a transfer of

collateral assets. The CDO liabilities then reference the cash flows

(principal and interest) of the collateral assets. But CDOs are increasingly

issued in synthetic form, where there is no physical transfer of collateral.

In these structures the CDO references default losses, rather than the cash

flows of the referenced collateral. 



Credit Default Swaps 



In their simplest form synthetic CDOs are akin to single name credit default

swaps. A credit default swap is a contract where one party ,the protection

buyer, makes periodic payments in exchange for payments contingent on a

credit event. In a single name credit default swap, the credit event is the

default of a single issuer. Thus, the price of the credit default swaps

reflects the market's view of the default likelihood of the reference name. 



In unfunded form a synthetic CDO is essentially a basket default swap. In

this case, in return for a premium, the protection seller makes contingent

payments based on the default losses incurred by a portfolio or basket of

assets. The protection may be for first loss or equity, in which case the

seller pays for the initial default losses, up to some threshold; second

loss or mezzanine, where the seller pays losses beyond the first loss

threshold up to some higher limit; or senior, where the seller pays all

losses beyond a threshold. 



Synthetic CDOs may also be structured in funded form. The simplest form of

this structure is a combination of a risk free bond and a basket default

swap. The initial investment is used to purchase the risk free bond and at

the outset the investor receives the risk free rate of interest from the

bond as well as premium payments from the basket default swap. As losses

occur on the reference portfolio the principal of the bond is reduced to pay

the required contingent payments. At the maturity of the structure the

investor receives the remaining principal of the risk free position. In both

funded and unfunded forms the pricing of synthetic CDOs is primarily a

matter of pricing the basket default swaps themselves. 



Correlation Products 



It is often said that synthetic CDOs are correlation products because their

value depends not only on the probability of default for each individual

name in the reference portfolio, but also on the correlation between those

names. Consider a simple case where the reference portfolio consists of two

names, each with a 5% probability of default. Assume two levels of

protection, one paying on the first default, and one paying on the second.

If the names are independent, then the probability that the first loss

protection is triggered is 1 - (0.95)2 = 9.75%, that is, 100% less the

chance that there are zero defaults. The probability that the second loss

protection is triggered is (0.05)2 = 0.25%, that is, only if there are two

defaults. On the other hand, if the defaults are perfectly correlated, then

there are only two possibilities: either both or neither of the names

default. Thus, the probability that either protection is triggered is the

probability that both names default, or 5%. Note that for the first loss

protection the increased correlation has reduced the likelihood that the

protection is invoked, and therefore reduced the fair price of this

protection. For the second loss piece, the increased correlation has

increased the trigger likelihood and fair price. 



The relationship between correlation and pricing holds generally for the

first loss and most senior levels of protection in basket default swaps. For

the first loss piece, since losses are capped, the pricing is driven

primarily by the likelihood that no losses occur, which increases with

correlation. For the senior piece, the pricing is driven by the likelihood

that an extreme loss occurs, which is greater in cases of higher

correlation. 



Pricing 



Based on the discussion above most pricing models require individual default

probabilities and a correlation across the names in the pool. Since

individual default probabilities can often be obtained from single name

credit-default swaps correlation is the main pricing parameter for synthetic

CDOs. 



Consider an example structure with USD36 million of collateral, where first

loss protects against the first USD5 million of losses, second loss protects

against the next USD10 million of losses, and the remaining losses are

protected by the senior tranche. We can model spreads on each of these

tranches at different correlation levels. For example, using a correlation

of 45%, we obtain model spreads of two basis points, 250bps and 1,642bps for

the senior, second loss, and first loss protection respectively. We can

repeat this exercise at different correlation levels to obtain the

sensitivity of spreads to changes in correlation. Figure 1 shows the

normalized cost of protection for each tranche at different correlation

levels. We can see that the cost of protection for the senior tranche

increases with increasing correlation, that is the cost increases as senior

debt gets riskier, while the first loss protection cost decreases with

increasing correlation, that is the cost decreases as equity gets less

risky. Note that, in this particular example the cost of second loss

protection behaves like senior as an increasing function of correlation. 



Implied Correlation 



We can back out an implied correlation for each tranche from CDO prices in

the same way we would obtain implied volatility from option prices and the

Black-Scholes pricing model. An implied correlation extracted in this

fashion depends on the specific CDO pricing model, but the observations

above hold generally. Suppose the market spreads for our example structure

are 2bps, 150bps and 2,000bps for the senior, second loss, and first loss

protection respectively. We can compare these observed spreads with our

model spreads to calibrate a correlation parameter for each tranche. For

example the model spread is equal to the observed spread for the senior

tranche, 2bps, when we price it using a 45% correlation. In other words, the

implied correlation for the senior tranche is 45%. The implied correlation

for each tranche can be inferred from Figure 1 as the correlation level with

which our pricing model recovers the observed market spread. We can see that

for the first and second loss tranches, the implied correlation is roughly

20%, while for the senior tranche the implied correlation is 45%. 



A first application of the implied correlation is to mark to market a

synthetic tranche on an ongoing basis. As we observe changes in the spreads

for the individual names in the pool, we can reprice the tranches above by

assuming the correlation level is constant, but updating the spreads.

Additionally, implied correlations can be used for relative value analysis.

For example, senior and second loss tranche protection increase in value as

correlation increases. Since both tranches depend on the same basket of

names, we would expect them to have a similar implied correlation. As

mentioned above, the implied correlation of the senior tranche (45%) is

significantly higher than that of the second loss tranche (20%). This means

that senior protection is expensive relative to second loss protection. We

can also perform relative value analysis across deals if we believe that the

pools in two different CDOs have similar characteristics, in terms of credit

quality, industry, and geographical distribution. For example, if two CDOs

have similar pools and structure we would expect to observe comparable

implied correlations for their senior tranches. All else being equal, a

discrepancy in implied correlation can serve as an indicator of a

discrepancy in price between the two structures. 





CFTC makes amendments to CFMA 2000

Risk News - October 29, 2001

By Naomi Humphries



The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has released the final rules

relating to the trading of equity futures products in the United States.

These rules implement provisions of the Commodity Futures Modernisation Act

of 2000 (CFMA) that lift the 19-year ban on the trading of single-stock and

narrow-based stock index futures in the US. 



The final rules are in line with the new CFMA statutory provisions regarding

the specification of listing standards and conditions for trading security

futures products. The rules also establish requirements related to the

self-certification of rules and rule amendments, reporting of data,

speculative position limits, and special provisions regarding the contract

design for the cash settlement and physical delivery of security futures

products. 



The CFTC received comment from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the

Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the American Stock Exchange (Amex)

and the Intermarket Surveillance Group (ISG). The CFTC adopted several

revisions consistent with comments, but stated: Generally, the commentators

supported the proposed rules. 



The CFTC also streamlined the trading process in its revisions of rules

governing commodity futures and options intermediaries on October 19,

following the enactment of the CFMA and the resulting revisions to the

Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). Key rules governing intermediaries, including

futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, commodity pool operators

and commodity trading advisers, have been revised to provide greater

flexibility consistent with the mandate of the CFMA to streamline and

eliminate unnecessary regulation for entities registered under the act. 



They include a provision for retail customers to have broad access to

registered derivatives transaction execution facilities, by permitting them

to trade through a commodity trading adviser with $25 million or more in

assets under management, and a proposal to replace the current prescriptive

rule over ethics with a statement of acceptable practices. 



The CFTC claimed that comments from Fimat, a registered futures commission

merchant, and securities broker-dealer, Exchange Analytics, an ethics

training provider, the CBOT, the National Futures Association and the

Managed Funds Association, all generally supported the adoption of the

proposed amendments for commodity futures and options intermediaries. It

added that the issue that generated the most discussion was ethics training.





Acting chairman at the CFTC, James Newsome, said: These rules are just the

first step in the Commission's review of appropriate regulatory relief for

intermediaries. We have begun the intermediary study that Congress directed

us to perform, and we may well be implementing additional regulatory reforms

prior to the study's conclusion. 







Banks tout economic derivatives

IFR - October 29, 2001



Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan will be using an auction mechanism to deliver

the new derivatives products, which they say will be self-clearing and

self-hedging. The solution licensed to the two banks to create derivatives

on economic statistics will also be applicable to corporate earnings and

revenues, mortgage prepayments, equity prices, central bank target rates,

index-related products, electric power, weather degree days, credit or any

event-driven market where the development of risk management tools has been

constrained by illiquidity, according to the developer of the solution, New

York-based Longitude.



Once the mechanisms are up and running and validated, we could envision

structured notes on swaps linked to the auction process itself, said JP

Morgan Chase's Chris Harvey, managing director of foreign exchange and

interest rate derivatives sales for the Americas.



Deutsche Bank has picked Germany's lfo and Japan's Tankan as the debut

products for its economic derivatives franchises in Europe and Japan. JP

Morgan Chase is still in the process of selecting its inaugural US economic

statistics product.



JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank declined to disclose the cost of their franchise

on the economic derivatives. To retain their exclusive agreements with

Longitude for the Parimutuel Digital Call Auction (PDCA)-enabled

derivatives, the banks must meet performance benchmarks. Longitude charges a

fee based on the notional volume cleared through its system.



Using Longitude's PDCA bookrunner product, Deutsche Bank, for example, would

engage in pre-marketing or preselling activity that is similar to that in a

bond or equity syndicate offering, followed by a short auction period.

During the auction period, the bank would submit orders to buy or sell

digital options on the economic data covered to Longitude's web-based

system.



Upon receipt of the orders, Longitude's system produces bid/offer prices for

the derivatives being offered, and other relevant market equilibrium

statistics, such as limit order books. Longitude routes this information

back to the bank, which publishes the statistics for its customers. In this

example, Deutsche Bank would be counterparty to transactions that are

filled.



An order that is filled would result in an International Swaps and

Derivatives Association-documented transaction. The filled orders should

hedge themselves because in a pari-mutuel system all claims that end

in-the-money are funded by those out-of-the-money. Longitude's clients can

offer derivatives without assuming additional risks on their own balance

sheets, said Andrew Lawrence, chief executive of Longitude. As the systern

accepts orders with limit prices, capital markets participants can have a

high level of price certainty.



In a pari-mutuel system, prices are market-driven and determined by customer

participation, rather than a model or subjective assessment of the price of

risk.



Doubfers

A pari-mutuel model is a demand and supply based market, so the question

becomes: Will there be enough participants? said Richard Sandor, chief

executive of Environmental Financial Products and one of the architects of

the interest rate futures markets.



Is it view taking or [traditional] hedging? I'm not sure, said one bulge

bracket firm's head of market risk management.



Numbers of participants are difficult to predict because they will depend

upon the design of the specific auction, said Longitude's Lawrence. Perhaps

as few as 10-15 total orders can form a very rich auction equilibrium, he

said.



The cost of operating the call auction is another consideration. A high

transaction charge will mean less money for the winners. It varies from

market to market. But because banks are not taking market risk, the price

for the service will be modest, said Lawrence. In general, it has always

been considered extremely desirable to disaggregate risk factors to the

fullest extent possible because they can always be easily recombined.



Let's assume a health maintenance organisation (HMO) wishes to hedge out

its exposure to annual medical cost inflation in the US, and that the health

industry accounts for slightly less than 20% of US gross domestic product.

What can this HMO do now in the traditional markets to mitigate this risk?

Not much. But JP Morgan could offer derivatives based directly upon this

very important measure in order to offer a risk management product for this

HMO, he said.



Both JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank are expecting early interest from financial

institutions, and fixed-income participants in particular, because no

mechanism for isolating and hedging or speculating on the growth rate of a

country's economy currently exists.



Deutsche Bank's strategy for introducing the new products will initially

hinge on drumming up internal interest, said Kevin Rodgers, global head of

currency options at Deutsche Bank in London. In January, the bank's trading

desks will start using it internally to hedge their own positions. This

activity will be useful in providing the bank with probability

distributions, he added.



Deutsche Bank will then try to get other banks' proprietary and swap desks

to use the system. The new products will probably be available for use by

hedge funds, commodity trading advisers and fund managers by the third

quarter of next year. JP Morgan Chase expects to start its franchise market

on US economic statistic derivatives next month.

By the way, Rod had suggested that I hold off on bothering you about my group's budget until after you complete this enormous endeavor.  However, FYI, I had submitted an approximately $2 million budget through Steve Kean's group and about $300,000 was submitted for Gina Taylor's group in the ETS budget.  I'm probably going to identify some reductions in these numbers.  Please let me know when you need details.

And



Portfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference



January 22-25, 2002, New York City, NY



OVERVIEW



 



In the current environment of volatile energy prices and deregulation, it has become increasingly more important for the electricity industry to learn how to manage price risk. EUCI presents two events formatted for the beginner to the expert in price risk management. The first Workshop is designed for the beginner with no prior experience in risk management and introduces the basic vocabulary and concepts in a concise and easily understandable format which forms the foundation for the more advanced concepts applied in the second event (Conference).



 



The brochure for the Electricity Risk Management 101 Workshop and the Portfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference can be obtained by clicking on the link below:



<http://www.euci.com/pdf/risk_mgmt.pdf>



 



Transmission Expansion and Systems in Transition Conference



Feb. 5-8, 2002, Miami, Florida



OVERVIEW



 



This conference will examine the business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO initiatives.  The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system.

Hello All,



    We will begin our soccer season with the first practice 

scheduled for this Wed (Aug 15) at 5:30 pm at the West U microsoccer 

fields (adjacent to West U Elementary School).  This week we will 

have one practice only.  Starting next week (Aug 20) there will be a 

Monday practice with the West U trainers at 5:30 (same fields).  This 

trainer practice is optional - however we found that the kids really 

get a lot out of these trainer practices and they are probably better 

for ball skills than what we will do in coaches practice.  We will 

discuss other issues on Wed.



I'm looking forward to a fun season.

Stacy:



It occurred to me that members of the North American Energy and Developing

Products Committee might be interested in participating in a discussion

about one of the changes to the Ontario Market Rules that is currently being

considered by the Board of Directors of the IMO (the Independent Electricity

Market Operator in Ontario).



The Ontario Market Rules have, to date, been designed such that generators

of electricity will receive a 5 minute price (EMP or energy market price)

from the IMO, and consumers of electricity receive an hourly price (the HOEP

or hourly Ontario energy price).  The HOEP was calculated as the weighted

average of the EMP for an hour.  For a variety of reasons, the IMO has now

decided to change the way that the HOEP is calculated, such that it will be

the straight average of the EMP's for the hour.  



Customers have already entered into swaps, fixing the price at which they

will purchase electricity, in which they pay a fixed price and receive the

HOEP in return.  Therefore, if the quantum of the HOEP is now different than

is was based under the formula in effect when the contract was entered into,

the economics of the deal have changed.



It's not clear at this time how material this change in calculation will be.

Will it make a $0.05 difference to the HOEP, or a $3.00 difference to the

HOEP?  In other words, is it a Material Change in Formula?



Let me know if you think this might be of interest to the members.

Mark and Jeff: There is an impression circulating among some of the commercial teams that their compensation may be directly linked to asset dispositions, ie. success fees.  Apparently, this may have started due to rumors that the London Receiver is allowing for such payments--for example, the pending Arcos turbine sale.  This is unsubstantiated, but may be worthy of inquiry.  Accordingly, in at least one domestic example, it is my understanding that the deal team was fairly unmotivated until they heard about the London arrangement and are now pursuing with great exuberance.  Maybe this is a good thing, but clearly an arrangement that needs to be vetted and then communicated so people understand what the rules may be.



Let me know how I may assist in addressing this.

Below is an update on the Adaytum Consolidated Model:



1) BU Basic Cubes' Training => last week (10/22 - 10/26), two training sessions were held - EEOS and EGAS. Provided in the training sessions were User Documentation, which included screen prints of Manager screens, as well as a word document with additional user instructions and screen shots of the data cubes. Also included were the Adaytum excel add-in reports (both summary and financial statements). Additional training sessions are scheduled for the next two weeks. If you have not done so already, please let me know your availability. The sessions lasts approximately 4 hours, and is done on-site.



NOTE: Most Enron computers have a minimum of 128K of RAM. In order for faster processing of data and accessing the cubes, we are recommending that everyone upgrade to an additional 128K of RAM (totalling 256K RAM). The cost of this upgrade is a nominal amount (under $25), and is well worth the investment.



To check the amount of memory on your machine, please do the following commands:



Start | Settings | Control Panel | System (Look under Computer for the amount of RAM you have).



2) Next Adaytum User Group Meeting => we will not have a meeting this week due to accounting close. However, I will schedule a meeting for next week (time and place to be determined). Potential topics for discussion are: (a) 2002 Plan information input into Adaytum (timeline), (b) Training update, and (c) Integration of actual / plan data between Adaytum and the Data Warehouse. Please forward to me any additional topic you may want to discuss.



Please call me if you have any comments or other items to discuss.

James,

For NNG IT, the Capital is up $2.2MM due to new projects and new business.

For NNG & TW, the primary explanations for the net increases in Direct Support are:



    Risk Management moved from Commercial to IT     $.3MM

    SAN                             $.3MM

    O&E Additional Support (staff) and new software     $.8MM

    Amortization - Future Vision Projects           $.3MM   

    EPSC                            $.7MM

        Totals to $2.4MM

 

The FA&A ETS Support variance (Measurement) is incorrect on the worksheet:  2001 C.E. is $1.6MM, 2002 Plan is $1.5MM.

I'll get Gas Logistics to you soon.

#sig#Thanks,

James,



I believe the Communications for 2002 should be $.2MM in NNG's Gas Logistics...

Anyway...



NNG 2002 increase is due primarily to:

    EPSC            $.3

    Less Capitalized    $.4

    Increase in Benefits    $.15

    Increase in Salaries    $.1

#sig#Hope this helps.

Tracy,



I'm sure you have no time for this now, but I wanted to get this information to you as soon as I had it.  I am very concerned to learn that only a part (approximately 1/3 or $680,000) was allocated out to EGS units as part of Steve Kean's budget.  (A disproportionately high $600,000 was allocated to EGM and the remaining $738,000 was retained at corp.)  It is my understanding that $470,000 was budgeted for the ETS communications group.  



Recognizing that my proposed corp. budget already reflected a decrease of approximately $ 1 million from the 2001 budget and $5 million from its 2000 budgets, it will be tight, but we could do our work as an EGS group if we were able to get the EGS allocations ($680,000), ETS communications budget ($470,000) and the portion that was unallocated corp. ($738,000), for a total of $1,888,000.  



I presume the problem with this is that it includes $738,000, which was not allocated to EGS entities.  Do you think this can be accommodated or should we look at keeping the budget at corp., with a reporting line to Stan?  (I have not broached this with Stan.)  I've attached spreadsheets with my corp. budget and Gina Taylor's ETS budget.  When you have time, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this with you.

Hello.  Your account has been corporately billed to Enron since 09/20/01.  There is, however, a balanced owed for the final bill under your personal liability for the same number.  We can transfer the entire balance owed to your corporate account with Enron's approval.  Please let us know.  Also, your Assignment & Assumption paperwork indicates that you want the corporate invoices sent to your home address.  If you indeed would like your EID number incorporated to your account for the I Buy It accounts payable system with Enron, then you will no longer receive paper invoices at home.  These invoices are paid directly on line by Enron Accounts Payable and they receive the invoices at a specific post office box.  Please let me us know what you decide and we can change your account information for you.  Thank you.

It's that time of year when all the school functions set out to raise funds for all their needs, and all of us are inundated with school fundraisers.  Thank Goodness, this is my last year of fundraising efforts for my children!!



My daughter, Michelle, is a High School Senior this year and is a 4th year member of the Stratford High School Spartanaires (Drill Team).  She has some pretty tall goals to achieve, and we both would really appreciate any business you can give us!



We have a very large selection of personalized (or not) Christmas and Holiday Cards for both personal and business use.  Your order will be shipped directly to you from the company.



We also have a great selection of personalized stationary (great for Holiday Gifts!).  These are also shipped directly to you or any address you choose.



In addition, we have a selection of Holiday gift ideas including wrapping paper, bows, candles, picture frames, Holiday Tins with cookies, candy, etc. and a variety of other Holiday fare.  I will deliver the items in this catalog to you at work.



We will be fundraising from now through October 29.  Michelle will be turning orders in each week on Tuesday morning, so order early to get your items early.  Michelle has to turn in her last order on Tuesday morning, October 30th.  The cards and stationary are generally received within two weeks of your order.



Please see Maria Perales (x31437) if you would like to look at the samples and you cannot reach me.  I have left the Big Holiday Card Sample Book with her, but have taken the other catalogs with me out of town for a few days.  I'll be back in the office on Thursday, Aug. 23rd with these catalogs.



Thanks to everyone for your support!  These products are very high quality, and you won't be disappointed!  Please forward this to anyone you know who may be interested in ordering and Thanks Again!

Resume Review:

The Analyst/Associate group is currently collecting resumes from the University of Houston.  We will be holding a resume review session sometime this week to select the students who will be invited to interview with us next week.  Since there are several resumes to review, we will be needing your help in the selection process.  An email will be sent to you stating the time and place of the review session.



# of Interviewers/Greeters Needed:

On campus interviews will take place on Mon-Nov 12th and Tues-Nov 13th.  Until we determine the number of students that will be interviewing, we do not know the exact number of interviewers needed.  Therefore, we are estimating 8 Interviewers are needed for Day 1 and 4 for Day 2.  Since it is not uncommon for an interviewer to be unable to volunteer due to business reasons, we need to have an alternate list as well.  We would like to have 4 alternates for each day.



We only need 3 Greeters each day.



Below are those already listed to interview:            Below are those already listed to greet:

All spending that can be delayed needs to be delayed.  I want to make it clear that items for health, safety, security and reliability that need to be spent will be spent, if necessary, but all other spending needs to be slowed down as much as possible and delayed until further notice.   This is a directive I have just received from Stan.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.



?   ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.

?   Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.



We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.
The following 12 applications will go for approval at the next executive

committee meeting on Thursday, November 1.

Competition Approved for California's Intrastate Natural-Gas Pipelines=20















By Will McNamara



Director, Electric Industry Analysis



















[News item from Associated Press] California state power regulators voted D=



ec. 11 to deregulate further the transmission of natural gas within Souther=



n California, a decision hailed by the industry and derided by consumer adv=



ocates. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) voted 3-2 to appr=



ove a proposal that allows Southern California Gas Co., the nation's larges=



t gas utility, and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (SDG&E) to sell space on th=



eir backbone transmission pipelines. These pipelines carry natural gas fr=



om out of state to a smaller distribution system in California that then tr=



ansports it to homes, businesses, factories, and power plants.







Analysis: This controversial vote by the CPUC took place last week, but has=



 not received a great amount of industry analysis. This is rather surprisin=



g because the vote carries enormous potential impact for the way in which n=



atural-gas capacity is bought and sold along pipelines owned by Southern Ca=



lifornia Gas Co. and SDG&E in the southern part of the state. Considering t=



he fiasco that opening the state's electric market became over the last yea=



r, it is a risky move for California's regulators to open a competitive mar=



ket for the right to transport gas along these pipelines at this time, even=



 though the issue has been under debate at the commission for years. Howeve=



r, the rationale for the decision is that the new system will allow custome=



rs to better control the point from which their natural-gas supply originat=



es, which theoretically should lower costs and preserve space along the pip=



elines that the customers don't need. Critics of the plan, especially The U=



tility Reform Network (TURN), say that allowing competition along the natur=



al-gas pipelines in California could allow fewer companies to control most =



of the pipeline space, which could in fact cause the opposite of the intend=



ed effect and drive up energy costs. A case that has been used by both side=



s of the debate is that of El Paso Corp., which found itself in a lengthy l=



awsuit this year when it was charged with giving preferential access to its=



 pipeline to one of its affiliates, which allegedly played a role in drivin=



g up energy costs in the state.







Before analyzing the potential impact of the CPUC's ruling, let's first est=



ablish specifically what the ruling entails and some background of the comp=



anies involved. Put into a nutshell, the ruling creates a competitive marke=



t for the right to transport and store natural gas along the pipelines owne=



d by Southern California Gas and SDG&E, which are both subsidiaries of San =



Diego-based Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE). As noted, Southern California Gas is=



 ranked as the largest natural-gas distribution utility in the country and =



serves a territory of 23,000-square-miles that ranges from central Californ=



ia to the Mexican border.







Following a standard that is already in place among interstate pipelines, i=



ncluding the ones that transport power into California, both of these compa=



nies will now be allowed to sell large industrial customers space on their =



intrastate backbone pipelines, giving customers firm transportation right=



s on the pipelines. The pipelines are referred to as backbone because the=



y are part of the smaller distribution system that transports power to fact=



ories and power plants (along with homes and businesses). It is important t=



o note that the CPUC's ruling impacts only large consumers of natural gas i=



n California, which includes electric generating plants. Residential and sm=



all business consumers that use natural gas will continue to have regulated=



 gas-transmission costs.=20







Under the new auction system, power producers and industrial natural-gas cu=



stomers of the two companies will bid to buy pipeline space, with preferenc=



e being given to those bidders that intend to reserve space for the longest=



 period of time. According to the CPUC, the ruling creates three tiers of=



 accessibility to the capacity on the pipelines. The first tier includes re=



sidential and small business customers, who are not included in the new com=



petition and will automatically have about 1,044 million cubic feet per day=



 of capacity on the pipelines reserved for their use. The second tier inclu=



des industrial customers who will now be able to participate in the competi=



tion, and will be allowed to bid on half of the remaining capacity. The thi=



rd tier includes all other market participants, including natural-gas marke=



ters, which will be allowed to bid on whatever capacity is left. Both South=



ern California Gas and SDG&E reportedly intend to phase in auctions by the =



end of 2002 for their largest customers to transport natural gas. The aucti=



ons will be for transmission rights that can be traded to other parties.=20







The CPUC also established two different levels of payment options for the b=



idding process. As one option, bidders can pay a fixed price of 7.2 cents p=



er million British thermal units (MMBtu) that would cover all of the capaci=



ty on the pipeline that they have reserved, regardless if it is ultimately =



used or not. As a second option, bidders can pay for only 50 percent of the=



 reserved capacity at the fixed price of 7.2 cents per MMBtu, and 50 percen=



t at a higher price that only applies to the capacity that they ultimately =



use. In addition, the ruling allows for the trading of capacity space, an i=



mportant point that critics claim could allow buyers to gain more control o=



ver the pipeline than allotted in the ruling.=20







As noted, the measure passed the CPUC in a 3-2 vote. The ruling will remain=



 in place until 2006, at which time the commission can decide to renew it. =



The three commissioners that supported the measure were Richard Bilas, Henr=



y Duque and Geoffrey Brown. Loretta Lynch, president of the CPUC, and Carl =



Wood voted against the measure. Wood said he opposed the measure because it=



 was based on data accumulated before natural-gas prices dramatically incre=



ased during the winter of 2000-2001.







Another reason why the three commissioners voted to approve this measure wa=



s a belief that deregulating gas transmission in the state would help to ke=



ep large customers from leaving intrastate pipelines in favor of using inte=



rstate pipelines, which are not regulated by the CPUC. An exodus among indu=



strial users from intrastate pipelines, according to the three commissioner=



s, could leave residential and small business consumers with higher costs a=



ssociated with maintaining the pipelines. However, regulators were quick to=



 qualify their vote by saying the decision to allow competition for the cos=



t of transporting natural gas for industrial users did not represent total =



deregulation. Instead, the commissioners said that the ruling simply amount=



s to less regulation.=20







As I mentioned, the case against El Paso Corp. (NYSE: EPG) was used as an e=



xample to support both sides of the debate over allowing competition among =



the natural-gas intrastate pipelines. The case against El Paso Corp. is a v=



ery complicated one, but it essentially comes down to one core issue. The c=



ase revolves around allegations that during the period of May to November 2=



000, El Paso improperly shared market-sensitive information with one of its=



 affiliates, which drove up natural-gas prices, pre-empted competition from=



 non-affiliated companies and resulted in extra costs for fuel in the range=



 of $3.7 billion for Californians. El Paso Corp. has consistently maintaine=



d that it engaged in no wrongdoing. According to a report issued by the sta=



te Assembly, natural-gas prices in California increased from $6.6 billion i=



n 1999 to $12.3 billion in 2000 to $7.9 billion for only the first three mo=



nths of 2001. In October, El Paso Corp. was absolved of the charges of mani=



pulating natural-gas prices in California, but an investigation continues r=



egarding any improper sharing of information between affiliates. The releva=



nce of this case is that those opposed to opening up California's intrastat=



e pipelines to capacity believe the new rules could allow for one company t=



o step in and gain control over a portion of the pipeline and thereby be ab=



le to drive up price.







Those in favor of the CPUC's new ruling say the comparisons to the El Paso =



case are unfounded. For starters, the ruling restricts companies from ownin=



g more than 30 percent of the pipeline, which theoretically should prevent =



a company from gaining an ability to control prices. Critics, however, say =



that the ruling allows for the trading of capacity space, which could poten=



tially provide a loophole that would give a company control over more than =



30 percent of pipeline capacity.=20







The issue of potential price spikes associated with natural gas is one of t=



he remaining questions that only time will be able to answer. Critics of th=



e ruling such as TURN say allowing competition among the natural-gas pipeli=



nes creates the same market dynamics as deregulation of the state's electri=



city market, which some say opened the door to gaming and market manipulati=



on. In other words, TURN argues, the CPUC ruling opens the door for one com=



pany to enter the market and buy up a significant amount of capacity along =



the intrastate gas pipelines, thereby giving that company the opportunity t=



o control prices. As the new ruling won't take effect until another year wh=



en Southern California Gas and SDG&E begin receiving bids for capacity spac=



e on their pipelines, we won't know any time soon if prices will be impacte=



d. However, critics claim that a sharp downturn in temperatures in Californ=



ia during the winter season that drives up demand could be the first indica=



tor of whether or not the new ruling will lead to a sharp increase in energ=



y prices.







Moreover, the opening of competition along capacity space on California's i=



ntrastate natural-gas pipelines is a surprising departure from the state's =



discontinuation of deregulation within the power sector. It is too early to=



 tell how the new ruling will impact energy prices, and of course this ques=



tion is the source of great debate (with one side saying that prices will d=



rop and the other side saying that prices will increase). Perhaps the large=



r issue, however, is the control over the state's pipelines that could be i=



mpacted by this ruling. Even 30-percent capacity control, the amount that t=



he CPUC is opening to competition, would be considered excessive by some ot=



her states. For instance, in Texas 20-percent control is considered a maxim=



um standard. Again, whether or not the allowance of competition will spark =



the abuse of capacity control on the intrastate pipelines is something that=



 remains to be seen. We do know that electric competition in California bec=



ame a disastrous experiment, but even with this history the state is moving=



 forward with bringing competition to its intrastate natural-gas pipelines.=

Earlier today, FERC issued the attached order approving an extension of the=



 NYISO's Automated Mitigation Procedures (also known as the AMP or Circuit =



Breaker) through April 30, 2002, rather than until October 31 as had been s=



ought by the ISO. Enron had submitted comments opposing the ISO's request. =



FERC also directs the ISO to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal that =



addresses FERC's concerns with the AMP as well as FERC's concerns regarding=



 how the ISO's overall mitigation measures work together. This proposal is =



due by March 1, to be effective May 1.=20



=20



FERC acknowledges two problems with the AMP that the NYISO has already comm=



itted to fix: limiting the mitigation to specific zones and hours that fail=



 the impact test, and exempting bids of less than 50 MW unless thee is a de=



monstrated  market power concern. In addition, FERC directs the ISO to work=



 with market participants to (1) examine whether the AMP may serve as a bar=



rier to entry for new generation, and whether such new generation should be=



 exempted from the AMP; (2) examine whether other energy limited resources,=



 including those constrained by environmental rules, should be exempted fro=



m or accommodated in the AMP. Currently, only hydro units are exempted beca=



use their volatile bids often reflect their opportunity costs, not market p=



ower. FERC believes this logic applies to all energy limited resources as w=



ell; (3) file a comprehensive mitigation proposal which also explains how t=



he AMP will work in conjunction with other mitigation measures already in e=



ffect or proposed, including the in-city mitigation  measures. FERC is conc=



erned here that that all the pieces may not fit together and there may be i=



nconsistencies and gaps; and (4) consider must-run  mitigation measures con=



sistent with ISO-NE and PJM. Again, FERC seems to be concerned here with tr=



ansmission constraints within NYC. (Note that the Con Ed distribution syste=



m is not secured by the ISO and this has been at the root of most of the ou=



t-of-merit calls in the City.)  Finally, FERC cautions the NYISO that it ex=



pects one mitigation plan for the Northeast as part of the RTO process, and=



 it encourages them to collaborate with PJM and ISO-NE in formulating its M=



arch 1 comprehensive mitigation plan.

Nuclear Experts Respond to Yucca Mountain IssueAlert 





By Robert C. Bellemare

Vice President



Brian O'Connell, P.E., Director of Nuclear Waste Program Office for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), and Janet Schlueter, Chief of Staff and Nuclear Materials Assistant for Commissioner Edward McGaffigan of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), sent us several clarifying points concerning Yucca Mountain and nuclear waste, which we believe should be shared with our readership. 



The action taken by the NRC on October 23 was not an approval of the Yucca Mountain site. What the NRC approved was the site suitability guidelines-the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Part 963 general repository siting guidelines that the DOE will use to evaluate Yucca Mountain when it submits a recommendation to the President on whether the site is suitable for the repository purpose. Then, after the unusual approval procedures of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), the next step would be to submit a license application to the NRC to build the repository. The Commission's concurrence on DOE's general repository siting rule is separate and distinct from any comments NRC may have on DOE's preliminary site suitability recommendation. 



According to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), 2,000 metric tons are generated by the nuclear industry per year, not 30,000 tons per year as we reported. The entire industry has produced about 40,000 metric tons of used nuclear fuel over the past four decades. 



Finally, the federal government may not be able to avoid responsibility for the actual transport of nuclear materials to Yucca Mountain. Section 137(a)(2) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act does call for the DOE to utilize by contract private industry to the fullest extent possible. Regardless of whether the shipments are made by the government or contractors, all shipments must meet NRC and other federal and state regulatory requirements. 



  <http://infostore.consultrci.com/spacerdot.gif?IssueAlert=10/26/2001>
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.



Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.



In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.



If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.
Latest forecast for 2001:



Net Income - $26MM

Revenues - $9-9.5 billion
Final Reminder



If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, all trades among your investment funds must be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26.



The makeup of your investment funds in the Savings Plan at 3:00 p.m., October 26, will reflect your investment decision for the duration of the transition period.

This relates to our conversation today about the retail contracts.  Thanks.
Stan's day just opened up for this Thursday the 4th, or we could do 2:30 to 5:00PM on Monday, October 29, or 2:30 to 5:00PM on Tuesday, October 30.   Otherwise, that's it.   Please advise asap.
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  



Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.
I've placed this meeting on John G's calendar for Monday, October 29th from 2:30 to 5:00.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.



Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.



Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 



Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.



Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.



You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.



You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  



If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.
NNG is billing fuel retention on out-of-balance deliveries.



We only collect the 4.5% on the receipt volumes, however NNG is charging fuel based on the receipt plus the out-of-balance delivery.

This out of balance collection goes to trackers.  We could lower the amounts over the 4.5% if NNG stops charging out-of-balance retention when this contract goes short.  (stop charging out-of-balance retention has other problems assocated with it). This contract was consistently short in 2001.  This is not all of the problem but it is the controllable part.  That is, we need to make these two contracts long to the system each month.  Or, put an OBA at Bushton's inlet (The OBA at Bushton's inlet also has other problems assocated with it).



Mike and Steve please confirm my calculations to the contract terms to see if I am correct, also can you set a meeting with Logistics, Regulatory and Tracy Geaccone to discuss. 



The non-controllable factors are NNG's Field fuel rate keeps increasing making it consistently over the 4.5%, and lower gas prices increase the exposure to EPPI.
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.



We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  



We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  



Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  



As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 



For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



The information provides further details about:



    -- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;

    -- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;

    -- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 

    -- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and

    -- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.



This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  



Restatement of Earnings



Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:



Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:



    -- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997

AES Hits Brick Wall in Venezuelan Acquisition=20

[News item from Reuters] Venezuelan telecommunications firm CANTV, or Compa=



nia Anomima Nacional Telefonos, facing a $1.37-billion hostile takeover bid=



 by AES Corp. (NYSE: AES) has forced a showdown with the U.S.-based global =



power company by announcing a share repurchase program. The Board of Direct=



ors of CANTV, Venezuela's biggest telecommunications company, recommended t=



hat shareholders approve a proposed share buyback program of up to 15 perce=



nt of CANTV's shares at a price of $30 per American Depositary Share (ADS),=



 or approximately $4.29 per share. Analysts said the CANTV Board's proposal=



s, which would be submitted to shareholders at an extraordinary meeting set=



 for Oct. 24, clearly flung down the gauntlet to AES.=20







Analysis: AES' expansion in Latin America's telecommunications market was a=



lways seen as a risky move, and now that risk seems to be resulting in a bi=



g bite out of the company's strategy. CANTV, which was an appealing takeove=



r target for AES due to its long-standing monopoly over the telecom market =



in Venezuela, has a strong ally in the form of Verizon Communications (NYSE=



: VZ), which holds a 28.5-percent stake in the company. Verizon came out in=



 support of the 15-percent repurchase program being launched by CANTV, whic=



h clearly is a form of aggressive resistance against AES' efforts to gain c=



ontrol over the company. The repurchase could be seen as a power play, with=



 Verizon also seeking to increase its share in CANTV, which many analysts m=



ight see as a more appropriate synergy. However, this story also highlights=



 the difficulty that AES has had with its expansion efforts in Latin Americ=



a, especially since CANTV's resistance comes on the heels of AES' pulling o=



ut of another acquisition project in Ecuador.=20







For background, it is important to note that AES already owns 6.9 percent o=



f CANTV through its majority ownership of Electricidad de Caracas, Venezuel=



a's largest private electricity company. Thus, the takeover effort is an at=



tempt to gain majority ownership of the company and take control away from =



Verizon. CANTV, which was privatized a decade ago, is a full-service teleco=



mmunications provider offering switched and local, domestic and internation=



al long-distance service throughout Venezuela Company. CANTV also offers mo=



bile cellular services, wireless services, Internet access and other value-=



added services, and owns all of the Venezuelan public exchanges and nationa=



l network of public telephone lines. CANTV became privatized about 10 years=



 ago and until last year reportedly had a monopoly on the fixed-line teleph=



one service in Venezuela. The company has a market capitalization of $2.6 b=



illion.=20







AES had bid $24 in cash for each of the 28.57-million U.S.-listed shares in=



 CANTV and $3.43 in cash for each of the 200 million shares of CANTV traded=



 in Venezuela. AES' offer for CANTV's American shares represents a 9.2-perc=



ent premium over CANTV's closing price of $21.98 on Aug. 29, the time at wh=



ich the takeover effort was launched. From the start of the offer, some cri=



tics charged that this bid was too low, but AES has maintained that the off=



er is fair. AES reportedly plans to sell off CANTV's mobile services, which=



 account for about a quarter of the company's revenues, and distribute the =



proceeds to shareholders.=20







CANTV was never very receptive to AES' bid, and did consider it to be a hos=



tile takeover. In fact, workers' representatives at CANTV circulated a stat=



ement strongly objecting to the bid from AES, stating that the deal would s=



everely damage Venezuela and CANTV workers. CANTV employees hold a 10.9-per=



cent interest in the company. Now we see that CANTV is upping that resistan=



ce a notch by attempting a repurchase of its own stock. Note that CANTV wil=



l most likely issue the buyback program at $30, compared to the $24 that AE=



S had offered. Thus, the challenge for AES, if it still wants to gain contr=



ol over CANTV, will be to increase its already 9.2-percent premium offer. T=



he word circulating in the industry is that AES still intends to proceed wi=



th its takeover attempt, and the CANTV strategy will not derail these attem=



pts.=20







AES' rationale for increasing its holdings in the company is most likely tw=



ofold in nature. First, AES obviously finds great appeal in the Latin Ameri=



can market as the company already owns electricity assets in Brazil, Chile =



and other countries. Just this week, AES announced its penetration of the A=



rgentina market by inking a $376-million deal to purchase distribution and =



generation assets in that country from New Jersey-based Public Service Ente=



rprise Group (PSEG). In another recent announcement, AES launched a cash te=



nder offer to acquire all of the outstanding loan participation certificate=



s of Empresa Electrica del Norte Grande in northern Chile, a company that c=



onsists of 716 MW of generation and 1,056 kilometers of transmission. In fa=



ct, AES reportedly rivals Spain's Endesa as the region's most dominant powe=



r company and by all appearances now derives a large part of its business t=



hroughout Latin America. Whereas AES was clearly diversified across the Uni=



ted States, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, many investors now perceive th=



e company as moving into a heavier focus on Latin America, which constitute=



s a risky proposition in and of itself due to unique politics in the variou=



s Latin American countries.=20







However, AES recently pulled out of its attempt to launch a $128-million ta=



keover bid for Chilean generator Edelnor. Currently, Edelnor, which is one =



of the largest electrical generators in Chile, is controlled by Mirant Corp=



., one of AES' direct competitors in the independent power producing market=



. Perhaps also reacting to the volatility in the region, Mirant has announc=



ed that it will not sink any additional capital into the Edelnor unit unles=



s it can be assured of repayment. AES did not give a reason for its decisio=



n to terminate the Edelnor takeover, but one can surmise that investor reac=



tor to its ongoing efforts in Venezuela may have been a significant factor.=



 Further, on Sept. 25, AES cut its earnings estimate for 2001 to a range of=



 $1.25 to $1.45 per share from a previous range of $1.75 to $1.90. AES blam=



ed poor currency exchange rates between the Brazilian real and U.S. dollar,=



 lower U.K. power prices, and the company's inability to replace earnings a=



nticipated from the planned acquisition of the Mohave power plant. The drop=



 in AES' earnings estimate may have lowered available capital that the comp=



any needed to purchase Edelnor.=20







AES shares were priced at $24.25 prior to the earnings revision. After the =



announcement, at least as of early morning trading on Sept. 27, AES shares =



were priced at $12.25, significantly down from the 52-week high of $73, whi=



ch is what the stock was priced at a year ago. As of early morning trading =



on Oct. 17, AES shares were priced at $14.81.=20







Moreover, investors did not react positively to AES' plan to increase its s=



take in CANTV. In fact, after word of the deal began to circulate on Aug. 2=



9 (a day on which many stocks fell) AES' stock closed down $2.94, or 8.3 pe=



rcent, to a 20-month low of $32.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. AES CEO =



Dennis Bakke immediately attempted to reassure investors that the purchase =



did not represent a change of strategy for AES, which he says will remain f=



ocused on power. In addition, Bakke noted that the purchase does not repres=



ent a new venture for AES as the company already holds telecom assets in Br=



azil and Bolivia. Further, Bakke clearly stated that AES is not going to a=



nnounce a bunch of telecom acquisitions around the world. Nevertheless, so=



me investors believe that AES is imprudently expanding into the telecom sec=



tor, which is already significantly troubled, and becoming too heavily entr=



enched in Latin America, a market that is prone to political volatility. On=



e investment analyst perhaps spoke for many when he commented that AES has =



little experience in the telecom sector and its limited experience to date =



has not been terribly successful. This, coupled with the general market dow=



nturn for most companies with telecom exposure, does not make for a good re=



cipe from an investor's perspective, at least as of today.=20







In fairness to AES, penetrating the Venezuelan market could represent a ver=



y strategic move from a long-term perspective. With a population of 23.5 mi=



llion, Venezuela represents a large potential market for energy and other r=



elated services. In addition, Venezuela is an asset-rich country, particula=



rly with regard to oil resources. According to the Department of Energy, Ve=



nezuela is important to world energy markets because it holds proven oil re=



serves of 77 billion barrels, plus billions of barrels of extra-heavy oil a=



nd bitumen. Venezuela consistently ranks as one the top suppliers of U.S. o=



il imports and is among the top 10 crude oil producers in the world. In add=



ition, as noted AES' investments in Latin America are not exclusively focus=



ed on Venezuela, as the company also is present in Argentina, Brazil, Chile=



, etc.=20







Concerns about telecom arguably overshadow concerns about expansion in Lati=



n America and play a larger role in the drop in AES' stock, especially when=



 we consider that AES has been present in Latin America for some time. Only=



 little more than a year ago, the telecom sector was at its peak, with bill=



ions of capital investment flooding into the sector as wildly optimistic ex=



pectations for demand seemingly exaggerated the scale of the market. Howeve=



r, a massive downturn has ensued, impacting not only companies operating in=



 the telecom space but the nation's entire economy as well. The bottom of t=



he telecom sector has fallen out, due in large part to the fact that the in=



crease in bandwidth capacity has outpaced the growth in market demand.=20







As I've said before when analyzing this company, the further that AES depar=



ts from its core strategy, the more likely it is that we will continue to s=



ee volatility in the company's stock. Up until these recent announcements, =



AES maintained that it was engaged in three lines of businesses, which were=



 all equally important to its strategy: power generation, network delivery =



services and retail energy marketing. Generation always appeared to be the =



main core of the company's business model, as AES controls some 125 facilit=



ies totaling over 44 gigawatts of capacity worldwide. This business model w=



orked well for AES and was well received by investors. Any perceived deviat=



ion from this successful strategy-especially if it includes expansion into =



the dangerous territory of telecom-could mark a new and risky era for AES.=



=20







Nevertheless, one could also surmise that AES has found a market opportunit=



y that is worth exploring. Latin America has low electrification and Intern=



et usage statistics. Some analysts project high growth in the next 5 to 10 =



years in Latin America in both electrification and Internet use, which in t=



urn involves telecommunications. The telecom industry is struggling at the =



moment. Thus, if one believes that telecom will make a comeback, then buyin=



g now may make a wise strategy for those involved.=20

All:

The contract maximum of 4.45% (not 4.5%) is based on both Field and Mainline fuel for the particular MID (10, 11, 12 and/or 13) in which the gas is received.  The attached spreadsheet is a history of the relevant MID fuels.  When the contract originated in December 1995 the MID average was below 4% and the contract generated modest revenue for NNG.



The 6/1/97 tariff revision greatly increased mainline fuels, especially in MID 11 where the majority of the contract volume is received, where the fuel jumped from 1.48% to 2.90%.  The 6/1/97 revision increased the volume weighted average fuel (a measure valid for comparison purposes only) from 3.81% to 4.65%, which until the 8/1/01 revision to 4.71% was the zenith.



Mainline fuel appears to be the problem: it has increased from 1.84% effective 6/1/99 to 2.25% effective 6/1/00 to 2.66% effective 8/1/01.  This .82% increment makes the difference between profit and our current situation.



Rita:

Can you tell us how we got here and what areas we could focus our attention on to potentially remedy the problem?  Which station have increased fuel consumption over the years?  And how are prior period adjustments made?  Can you send me the calculation spreadsheets for the relevant tariff revision periods?

Julia:



The EGM group is delivering to you this afternoon completed matrices for all of our material physical trading contract forms and selected counterparty-specific contracts, in each case organized by commodity traded. 



Just a few things to note: (i) we have not included in our review the EGM trading contract forms for Japan, Australia and Singapore due to the time constraints (please advise if you would like matrices done for those offices); (ii) we have not included a review of trading contract forms used by EGM-related entities in Europe as we assumed that Justin Boyd's team (I left a message for Justin this morning, but I did not get a confirmation back) would handle; and (iii) finally, we are not attaching the templates to the matrices, but we can certainly provide them if and when needed.



Please let me know if there is anything else you need.



Alan
Dan Leff's contact info for 12/22-12/30

Cell - 713-560-1508

Lake Placid - 518-523-1373 or Line 2 - 518-523-9870
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  



Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.



I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.



Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.
You know, I am just too busy to deal with the tone of your messages right now.   Give me a contact at AA and as soon as I finish my budget and pricing projects I will call them directly.    



Before I can do anything, I need the Enron company number for EGP fuels. I do know that our actuary has never broken out the expense or PBO for this company.  Until I know what the company number is we won't know which ETS group it was consolidated within.  Probably the Services Group, but maybe Corp.  Once we know that then either the ETS accounting or corp. accounting can look into the actual intercompany allocations if any.  Tracy, can you do me a favor and look into how you all do the accounting for this company and I'll try to give you a call later this week.   (Tracy, I may be able to locate the 2000 and possibly the 2001 allocation sheets but I am  not comfortable that we will still have the budget information for 1998 and 1999.  In addition, the true-ups definately do not go to this level.)



Arthur Anderson is in the process of completing the preparation of audited financials for EGP Fuels Company.  Included with these financials are footnote 

    disclosures.  Please provide the following information to be included with these financials.



    1)  Total charges from Enron Corp for EGP Fuels employee benefit plans for 1998, 1999, and 2000.  (I would think that the books of EGP should show the actual charges.  Our reserve records only provide a total distribution allocation.  This will have to come from accounting.)



    2)  EGP Fuels' Enron Retirement Plan pension costs for 1998, 1999, and 2000.  (As stated, this is not prepared at the EGP level.  The best we can do here is to work with the actuary to do an estimate of the costs but this will likely require a historical pull of information which you may or may not have available. I'll need to speak with AA&CO directly to determine best course of action.)



    3)  EGP Fuels' Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation (APBO) for benefit plans other than pensions net periodic postretirement benefit costs for 1998,

         1999, and 2000.  (Same as above.)
Let me give you my thoughts.

We acquired MGT on April 30.  If you include O&M expenses prior to that period of time you will be including all of the MGT salaries, allocations and overheads for which we had no responsibility.

El Paso, through the transition services agreement, is performing the accounting functions for MGT.  Each month someone in my department provides to them actual expenses paid through Enron that need to be recorded as O&M on MGT.  These are additive to those expenses processed through the El Paso system.  

I believe you should be picking up actuals from May 1 forward.
have fun with this
I was tied up in some other meetings and wasn't able to attend.  Do we have the final info, detail and presentation package for next Friday with Stan?  How about Stan frequently asked question response?   MK

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 





All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

no collateral.

hodge looked at gas. older master stemming from enron access (??) days. index pricing.

he is handling termination of service and noticing. he is looking at metals too to confirm nothing unusual. will alert you if is.
What do you think?     I think we should be managing to improve the bottom line.
Not unexpectedly this seems to me consistent with our thinking so far..



I am with Diane - I think ISDA can serve a valuable function by coming out with a statement saying that a) we have canvassed many dealers in the market and the prevailing opinion is that the

particular Railtrack Convertible is deliverable b) we do not see it as ISDA's place to make binding interpretations on the market, but our own interpretation is consistent with this view and c) attach

the Potts QC Opinion (if we are permitted to do so) 



But we shouldn't play this up as another issue for the Credit Derivative market beyond what it is. And as more of these types of matters arise we should consider what criteria dictate our

involvement

TXU Sells Two Texas Power



Plants to Exelon; Sale Supports



Strategies of Both Companies=20















By Will McNamara



Director, Electric Industry Analysis















[News item from PRNewswire] TXU Corp. (NYSE: TXU) and Exelon Generation ann=



ounced an agreement to sell two large TXU gas-fired electric generating pla=



nts to Exelon Generation, a subsidiary of Exelon Corp. (NYSE: EXC) for $433=



 million. The transaction, involving two Dallas/Fort Worth plants with a co=



mbined capacity of 2,334 MW will allow Exelon Generation to expand its pres=



ence in the Texas region, enhancing its geographic and market diversity, wh=



ile providing TXU with the opportunity to expand beyond Texas.=20







Analysis: Perhaps the key factor about this deal is that it supports the st=



rategies of both companies particularly well. TXU, one of the largest gener=



ation companies in the world, has been attempting to expand out of its home=



 state of Texas for some time, following competitive opportunities as they =



are presented by electric deregulation. The company, which will maintain a =



presence in the Texas market, has already expanded internationally into cou=



ntries such as Australia and Europe, and will mostly likely use the proceed=



s from the divestiture of its two Texas plants to expand further in the Uni=



ted States. For Exelon, the deal provides a foothold into the expanding Tex=



as market, which becomes fully competitive next week, and provides a partic=



ularly valuable inroad into the high-demand region of Dallas/Fort Worth.







Let's first establish some important data about the two plants that TXU is =



selling to Exelon. As noted, the combined capacity of the two plants is abo=



ut 2,334 MW. One of the plants is the 1,441-MW Handley Steam Electric Stati=



on, which is located southeast of Fort Worth. According to TXU, 412,000 bar=



rels of oil can be stored on site to fuel five oil/gas units at the plant. =



Handley is cooled by water from Lake Arlington. The first unit was put into=



 operation in 1948, with the additional units coming on line in 1950, 1963,=



 1976, and 1977. The other plant being sold is the 893-MW Mountain Creek St=



eam Electric Station, which is located about two miles west of Loop 12 in D=



allas. With the first oil/gas unit established in 1945, four more units wer=



e added in 1949, 1956, 1958, and 1967. Both sales include the generating un=



its of the plants, along with all of the other assets that are necessary fo=



r them to operate (land, water rights, transmission interconnections, gas p=



ipeline interconnections, production facilities, and emission allowances).







The strategies of both companies that are driving these transactions are pr=



etty straightforward. From TXU's perspective, the sales will reduce the com=



pany's generation concentration in a single U.S. market, which up to this p=



oint has been primarily in its home state of Texas. Proceeds from the sale =



apparently will be used to help TXU to expand in other North American marke=



ts outside of Texas. In addition, proceeds from the sale will be used to st=



rengthen TXU's balance sheet by reducing debt, something that has become in=



creasingly important to all companies operating in the competitive energy s=



pace since the bankruptcy of market-leader Enron. It is important to note t=



hat TXU has no plans to exit the Texas market, and still intends to operate=



 in the state as a generation company and retailer. Note that according to =



Texas restructuring law, there must be a wall between the two operating uni=



ts, which must function as separate companies. In essence, the divestiture =



is merely being used as a strategy for TXU to free up necessary cash that w=



ill support growth into other markets, and reduce the amount of potential m=



arket power that the company may have in Texas.=20







The issue of market power is another new factor that has developed in the l=



atter half of this year, considering that recent rulings by the Federal Ene=



rgy Regulatory Commission (FERC) have forced several other companies to cha=



rge cost-based prices for some wholesale transactions if they are deemed to=



 hold market power in their particular service territories. Texas law allow=



s a company to own and control no more than 20 percent of capacity within t=



he Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), and TXU claims that it is=



 within this cap. However, TXU acknowledges that it had an over-concentrati=



on of generating capacity in one market and wanted to expand into other mar=



kets. Excluding the sold facilities, TXU will now own 18,651 MW of net capa=



city, which are still located primarily in Texas. However, it is becoming c=



lear that TXU intends to reduce its role in the Texas generation market.







From Exelon's perspective, the sale expands the company's generating capaci=



ty by about 10 percent, which is an important increase considering that Exe=



lon is attempting to maintain its position as one of the industry's largest=



 asset-based traders. Exelon, which was created as a result of the merger b=



etween PECO Energy and Commonwealth Edison, is known mostly for its strong =



nuclear capabilities. In fact, Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet in the =



nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear industry, =



owning a total of 17 reactors that produce about 17,000 MW of power. Exelon=



 may be attempting to create a more diversified generation portfolio. Exelo=



n Power, which will manage the output of the two plants bought from TXU, ov=



ersees Exelon's portfolio of coal, natural gas, oil, landfill gas, and hydr=



o generating assets, which include 72 intermediate and peaking units in Pen=



nsylvania and Maryland (capable of producing 4,800 MW of net generating cap=



acity). Thus, Exelon's purchase of the two TXU plants could be seen as an e=



ffort to diversify, both regionally and from a power-source perspective, fr=



om the company's previous focus on nuclear power in the Northeast.=20







Perhaps equally important, the sale provides a valuable inroad to the Texas=



 market, which represents the second-largest energy market (behind Californ=



ia), offering a market value of about $20 billion. Now that California is n=



o longer a competitive energy market, there are high hopes that Texas will =



prove to be a flourishing market once full competition begins in the state =



next week. On Jan.1, 2002, most customers of investor-owned utilities in Te=



xas will have the opportunity to choose a Retail Electric Provider (REP)-th=



e company that provides their electricity. As a whole, the Texas energy mar=



ket represents 70,000 MW of generation operating on a 37,000-mile transmiss=



ion network.=20







One of Exelon's main objectives is to expand its portfolio of generation as=



sets and position itself as one of the nation's top-tier energy suppliers. =



Penetrating a state like Texas seems like a natural step for Exelon, which =



up to this point has developing generating assets that stretch from Chicago=



 to Pennsylvania. This is not the first expansion that Exelon has made into=



 the Texas market. In the summer of 2001, Exelon began operating a new 165-=



MW combustion turbine known as the ExTex LaPorte plant near Houston. Prior =



to that, Exelon had already become involved in marketing power output from =



two other plants in Texas (830 MW from the Tenaska Frontier plant and 350 M=



W from the Wolf Hollow plant).







It is important to note that Exelon and TXU are competitors in the Texas ma=



rket, especially on the wholesale side of the business, and thus there are =



fine lines drawn between the companies in light of the sales contract. Unde=

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.

We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.

 

David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.

We are going to have to retain Kyle to work out Canada.  To date he has not received any retention money.  I believe - although I am not sure - that we have more flexibility since Kyle is an employee of Enron Canada (solvent).  Let me know your thoughts.  Kyle would like $500,000 US.

Looks good to me with the following suggestions:





2.2 Service Level Agreement.  EBS will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the EBS Services in accordance with Appendix 2 to the Services Agreement; provided, however, Microsoft shall not be entitled to Liquidated Damages or other damages in the event of any SLA Failure.  Microsoft recognizes that the EBS Services has yet been through testing and that as a result the performance of the EBS will be negatively impacted.  EBS will use commercially reasonably efforts to test the system concurrently with delivering the EBS Services. NOTE:  (This may not be necessary as 1) there are no damages  2)  we are only held to a commercially reasonable standard anyway.



    2.3 Termination for Convenience.  Microsoft shall not be entitled to terminate the Services Agreement for convenience or for any other reason, except as expressly set forth in Sections 12.1.1, 12.1.2, and 12.1.4 of the Services Agreement.  Also 12.1.3  (EBS right to terminate)?
Yes, it was good. I am leaving now to go pick up my bike. I may try to take the other one to get a picture. Take care. Love you.
This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.



Here's a rundown of events from last week:



    We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.

    Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.

-   The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.

    The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.

      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.



Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:



    EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.

    EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.

      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.



Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.



And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.



Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

I really really want to get out of here.  I was just told by my admin. that when I get here at 6:45 am that Renee gets in a little after me and is watching me, so I need to be careful of what I do.  What do they think I do play around.  This makes me so mad, I could scream.
Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

I would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully able to explain the trends on these sheets.   I would also like to begin to add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible.   Accounting quite possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as possible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do this again.   This is not a project that will be complete by friday, but it does need to get complete this year.

Do you have any idea how many meetings are being set up for Stan's world?   I would imagine there will be one for ETS and a second one for EGAS (Jim Hughes).     I would like to be involved in both discussions if possible.
Following the recent administration of Railtrack and the draft Memorandum to Members of 11 October circulated by ISDA (copy attached for info), a number of you have expressed a wish to formally respond to ISDA on the issues raised.



I've attached the draft we propose to send to ISDA.  If you could let me have any thoughts/comments on the draft as soon as possible. 



I'll leave the decision as to when/if to submit the letter to Bryan.

Agree with these comments given that much of the regulatory oversight is now

with the FSA.  I would also support the application.
This should be my final (I hope).
Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.



Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

This will confirm that the meetings with Weil for Sat and Sun will begin at 10am. Mark wants the entire team to be present for the Sat meeting. We will decide after that meeting who needs to be present on Sun. I have sent Weil a number of materials, including the 3rd quarter results given to the analysts. We anticipate that Sat will be a lawyers only meeting to discuss the corporate structure and the bankruptcy issues related to the different business units. The meeting will probably last 4-5 hours.

 

The Sun meeting will include the commercial team. An agenda will be prepared, but most of the day will be devoted to information gathering and brainstorming.
Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =



of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.







We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=



ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=



y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=



ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.







It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =



of significant events that led to our current situation:







-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=



re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=



rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=



r imagined when we made these investments;







-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=



ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=



tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;







-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=



vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;







-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=



stand financial and operating disclosures; and







-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=



iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=



usly reported earnings.







We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=



 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.







Core Businesses







Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=



nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=



ese include:







-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;







-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;







-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and







-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.







The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=



r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=



me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=



 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=



.







I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =



of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =



concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=



mprovement in our counterparty relationships.







Non-Core Businesses







Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=



ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=



 return from them has been dismal.







We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =



that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=



 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=



ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=



ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=



G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=



s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=



 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.







Businesses Under Review







These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=



s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=



eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=



rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=



icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.







Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=



 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=



ecomes available.







Credit Rating/10-Q Filing







We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =



our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=



lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=



edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:







-- Moody's at Baa3       Under Review for Further Downgrade







-- Fitch at BBB-             Evolving Status







-- S&P at BBB-              CreditWatch Negative







We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=



 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=



0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =



19.







We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=



ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =



call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =



few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=



stors under SEC Filings.

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =



joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=



n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=



xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=



 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=



curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=

Mirant Becomes No. 2 Gas Marketer;=20



New Acquisition Cements Canada as Top Spot for Gas Resources=20















By Will McNamara



Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20











  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>







[News item from PR Newswire] Mirant Corp. (NYSE: MIR) announced on Oct. 11 =



that it intends to acquire the majority of the gas marketing business of Ca=



lgary-based TransCanada Pipelines Limited, a move that would make the compa=



ny the largest natural-gas marketer in Canada, the largest natural-gas expo=



rter to the United States and the number-two gas marketer in North America.=



 Terms of the purchase were not disclosed, although it is expected to close=



 in the fourth quarter of this year, pending approvals from regulators, pro=



ducers and customers.=20







Analysis: It's nothing short of amazing the number of natural-gas transacti=



ons that have taken place between U.S. integrated energy firms and Canadian=



 gas companies in 2001 alone. As is often the case, what seemed like a tren=



d now appears to be an industry standard, as those U.S. power firms consoli=



dating in the natural-gas sector look northward to Canada for acquisition t=



argets. Canada, which offers seemingly abundant natural-gas resources, has =



attracted such U.S. energy companies Calpine, Devon and Duke, which have al=



so bought gas outlets in the Great White North this year. This particular a=



cquisition is significant because it positions Mirant, which already had as=



sets in the Western part of Canada, as the largest gas marketer in Canada a=



nd right behind Enron elsewhere in North America, especially in the U.S. Mi=



dwest and Northeast. Further, the purchase of TransCanada gives Mirant a de=



cided edge on the increasing exports of natural gas from Canada to the Unit=



ed States, adding upon its already-significant portfolio.=20







As always when discussing a merger or acquisition, I like to first establis=



h the key elements of the deal before addressing the larger strategic gains=



 of the parties involved. Mirant is of course the recently spun off, former=



 subsidiary of Southern Company which over the last year has become one of =



the most aggressive and visible energy companies operating in the unregulat=



ed wholesale sector. The company's business model is founded on building a =



huge arsenal of generating assets, particularly based in natural gas, which=



 can be marketed and traded in strategic regions. Even before the announcem=



ent of this acquisition, Mirant owned an estimated 96 billion cubic feet of=



 proven oil and gas reserves, 82 percent of which are natural gas. Accordin=



g to the company, a substantial portion of its 38 million cubic feet equiva=



lent per day that is in current production is contracted to be sold at an a=



verage fixed price of $4/MMBtu through 2002. Further, Mirant has establishe=



d a solid reputation as a leading gas marketer and trader in North and Sout=



h America, Europe, and Asia. The purchase of TransCanada's gas marketing bu=



siness will add 5.1 billion cubic feet per day of gas reserves to Mirant's =



existing volumes (based on TransCanada's 2000 trading volumes), which as no=



ted significantly elevates Mirant's stature in the gas-marketing space.=20







The most important thing to note about TransCanada's business model is that=



 the company has established a strong niche in transporting natural gas fro=



m Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and Canada's Mackenzie Delta into the growing North =



American marketplace, supporting two separate pipelines (one from each basi=



n). This has been a slow-growth business for TransCanada, and in fact has l=



ost money over the last year, but is positioned for strong growth in the fu=



ture given the projected increase in demand for natural gas in North Americ=



a. TransCanada has been attempting to sell its gas marketing business for s=



ome time in an effort to focus more exclusively on its North American gas t=



ransmission and electrical power services. Last month, the company sold ano=



ther chunk of its U.S. natural-gas marketing and trading operations to BP G=



as and Power. Some of the motivation for TransCanada to focus exclusively o=



n this business might have arisen from concerns about perceived conflicts b=



etween its marketing / shipping business and pipeline systems.=20







From a broad perspective, this is a good move for Mirant. As noted, the com=



pany already has assets in Western Canada, where it has operated since June=



 2000 through its management of the natural-gas marketing operations of Pan=



-Alberta Gas Ltd. and CanWest Gas Supply, Inc. The purchase of core busines=



ses of TransCanada extends Mirant's presence into Eastern Canada by gaining=



 control over TransCanada's Quebec and Ontario operations. Specifically, Mi=



rant gains control over TransCanada's natural-gas trading and marketing bus=



iness and the related transportation and storage contracts, with business c=



ontracts in the Midwest and Northeast United States. In addition, TransCana=



da has agreed to sell its netback pool, or the part of its operation that=



 has aggregated gas supply from about 550 natural-gas producers. As noted, =



the aggregated supply should increase Mirant's marketable reserves by 5.1 b=



illion cubic feet per day. Although financial terms were not disclosed, a M=



irant executive indicated that the acquisition would enable the company to =



establish a leading market position through minimal investment.=20







The acquisition of TransCanada is by no means a surprise as it factors in v=



ery well to Mirant's growth strategy. Just this week, Mirant announced that=



 it had acquired an interest in 18 natural-gas and oil producing fields as =



well as 206,000 acres of mineral rights in South Louisiana from Castex Ener=



gy. This purchase followed purchases announced last August in which Mirant =



agreed to acquire two power plants in Florida and Georgia from El Paso Corp=



oration. The additional generating capacity from the El Paso facilities wou=



ld bring Mirant closer to its aggressive target of owning or controlling 35=



,000 MW in North America by 2005. Mirant is acquiring from El Paso a 640-MW=



 natural gas-fired power plant in Thomaston, Ga., and a 480-MW natural gas-=



fired plant in New Port Richey, Fla., north of Tampa. The agreement is expe=



cted to close this month, pending regulatory and third-party approvals.=20







As noted, Mirant is just the latest in a string of U.S. energy companies th=



at have made purchases of Canadian gas companies. Driven by what appear to =



be abundant natural-gas reserve fields in Canada, and uncertain resources i=



n more traditional areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, the gas consolidation =



movement among U.S. energy companies includes acquiring those firms that ar=



e involved in both production and transportation of natural gas. Some recen=



t reports I've seen have indicated that, since 1991, natural-gas imports to=



 the United States (mostly coming from Canada) have doubled to about 10 bil=



lion cubic feet per day, while domestic production has increased only 4 per=



cent (although it still averages 52 billion cubic feet per day). Further, a=



ccording to the Department of Energy, U.S. imports of natural gas from Cana=



da have averaged about 15 percent of total U.S. usage (during 2000, the Uni=



ted States consumed 22.8 Tcf and imported about 3.6 Tcf, mostly from Canada=



). The other factor driving this interest in Canadian natural-gas firms is =



the relatively lower valuations of Canadian energy stocks.=20







Worth noting in this movement is Duke Energy, which announced its purchase =



of Canada's Westcoast Energy for $3.5 billion in late September. Westcoast =



Energy owns the main pipeline that transports natural gas into the United S=



tates, which is a booming market for natural-gas demand given its use in ne=



w power plant projects. The acquisition should give Duke control over natur=



al-gas supply in Canada and the pipelines needed to export it. It is import=



ant to note that Duke has found its niche in the Canadian natural-gas marke=



t by focusing on the transportation of the commodity. Mirant is taking a di=



fferent approach by focusing on the marketing side of the business. Also wo=



rth noting in the Canadian market is Devon Energy, which is buying Anderson=



 Exploration, which reportedly will position it as the largest independent =



producer of oil and natural gas in North America.=20







Ironically, this increased interest in Canadian natural-gas firms is taking=



 place at a time when Canadian natural-gas storage levels could be much hig=



her than reported, bringing prices down to (CAN) $1.75 per million cubic fe=



et over the next few weeks. In fact, natural-gas prices in Canada have drop=



ped about 80 percent since the beginning of 2001, with Alberta's benchmark =



AECO-C Hub prices dropping more than 40 percent in the past two months. In =



addition to the high storage levels, mild weather, a drop in consumption of=



 natural gas and the struggling North American economy are also considered =



to be factors in the drop in prices. However, this does appear to be a temp=



orary trend, and companies such as Mirant are betting that prices will once=



 again increase, starting with the imminent winter season.=20







Moreover, as noted the purchase of TransCanada will reportedly make Mirant =



the second-largest gas marketer in North America. According to the most cur=



rent data available, based on 2000 sales, Enron Wholesale Services remains =



the largest natural-gas marketer in North America, with 28.3 billion cubic =



feet / day of sales in 2000, representing an 82.6-percent increase over 199=



9 levels. Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, Dynegy Marketing and Trade, Co=



ral Energy, and Reliant Energy round out the top companies. Interestingly, =



Mirant was not even listed on the year-2000 sales ranking because it did no=



t fully spin off from parent Southern Company until late in the year. Conse=



quently, the ascendance into the top tier of natural-gas marketers that Mir=



ant should achieve through this single purchase of TransCanada is quite imp=



ressive.=20

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



The information provides further details about:



    -- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;

    -- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;

    -- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 

    -- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and

    -- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.



This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  



Restatement of Earnings



Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:



Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:



    -- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997

    -- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998

    -- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 

    -- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000

    -- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 

    -- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001

    -- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  



The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.



The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.



You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.



We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.
Is the same true for the current estimate?
I have a very important video announcement about the future of our company.  Please go to <http://home.enron.com/message/> to access the video.  Thank you.
i fully agree with Jerry.

Thanks. I love you and miss you.
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.



Deal Terms



--  The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.

--  ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.

--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.

--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.



Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.



Management of Newly Formed Company



Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.



I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.



Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.



The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.



As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.



I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.



I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.



And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.





Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.



In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered participants in the solicitation of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.
bob,

i am a supporter.  in our dealings we see the bank as a growing user of

derivatives and feel comfortable with the separation from the FSA.  the new

role the bank plays is more akin to what some of the other central banks in

europe do rather than the fed or boj.
In September I sent you all a summary of the facts at issue in the above-referenced lawsuit. Since that time, several developments have occurred.  First, the trial date was moved from October 11, 2001 to November 13, 2001.  We have no reason to believe that we will not go to trial on the 13th.  We expect the trial to last from 10 days to 2 weeks. Judge Ira Gammerman will try the case. There is no jury. 

    The second development deals with the proposed summary judgment motions mentioned in my last e-mail.  Summary judgments on liability and damages have been filed and the plaintiffs have responded.  We have filed replies to their opposition papers.  In addition, the plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment as to liability.  We filed opposition papers to this motion.  New York practice differs somewhat from Texas practice to the extent that we have no firm date for a hearing on these motions.  Although we are attempting to get a hearing before the trial date, the judge has complete discretion as to whether to hear the parties' motions for summary judgment before the start of trial.

    The third development relates to the plaintiffs' theory of the case. It seems clear from the papers filed in response to our motions for summary judgment that the plaintiffs are fine-tuning their case to focus on the contracts' size distribution requirement arguing that the type of coal supplied by Enron, whether crushed or not, could never meet the contracts' size distribution requirement. The plaintiffs make this argument in simple terms and, when argued as such, it has some appeal. However, it is Enron's position that the contracts' language is ambiguous and the better (and much more complicated) approach advanced by the defendants is that the subject coal could and would have met the size distribution requirements. Issues of whether the contracts are installment contracts also play heavily in this analysis. 

    Fourth, since the last e-mail on this matter, we have learned that the plaintiffs are seeking $71 million in damages from Enron. This is approximately half of the amount of the contracts' damage cap. 

    Lastly, we finally received a response from the plaintiffs to the settlement proposal we made in June. The plaintiffs have offered to resolve this matter for a cash payment by Enron of $45 million. In the alternative, the plaintiffs have proposed a business alternative which is currently being investigated. Additionally, there is some discussion of mediation in the limited time remaining before trial.

    Should you have any questions about this case or should you need any further information, please call me.
Tracy,



We trying to find a time on Hughes schedule.  I will pin him down today on a time.



Sommers
Greg Markel, our outside counsel,  just received a phone call from Sempra's outside counsel informing him that, as a result of Enron's current financial condition, Sempra was no longer interested in pursuing a commercial resolution of the parties' disputes. Sempra's counsel said that Sempra was still interested in pursuing mediation if Enron was willing to consider paying Sempra money.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:

    The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business

school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic

that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work

experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your

application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially

improve in a short period of time.



THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:

    All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA

Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,

of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business

participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The

Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.



Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.



I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.



Thank you.
Please find attached file. I will be tied up with Rod's people (Corp. Development) from 2-4 PM this afternoon.
Yesterday we received a supplement to the plaintiffs' discovery that contained a damage report from the plaintiffs' damage experts. 

    Plaintiffs are claiming $71 million.  This number takes into account the amounts allegedly lost from breach through March 2002, the date the plaintiffs claim they will have both machines up and running. More specifically, this number is based on:

    1.  The alleged actual costs associated with moving, operating and using the machine that was moved back to Somerset. ($12 million for 2001/ $5 million for 1/02-3/02- Total $17million)

    2.  Lost tax credits grossed-up for the machine that remained at Pier IX but, according to plaintiffs, was unable to make any synfuel because the plaintiffs purportedly could not get the coal to operate it. ($54 million)

    By only using the period from breach through March 2002, the plaintiffs have avoided having to make any assumptions about the spread and also have avoided having to take into account any long-term cost-savings that Enron's alleged breach provided which, we argue, they would have to apply to offset their early damages.

    We are analyzing the plaintiffs' numbers and will get back to you.
Yes, Maria will call you today to schedule for the week after Thanksgiving.  We met on November 1st to discuss the issues listed below, and Greg has been working to develop an ETS solution to our needs since then.  I've inserted Greg's agenda from the Nov. 1st meeting with everyone listed in his invitation for your information.  We'll be sure to include Barry and Cheryl also.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =



of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.







We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=



ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=



y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=



ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.







It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =



of significant events that led to our current situation:







-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=



re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=



rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=



r imagined when we made these investments;







-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=



ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=



tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;







-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=



vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;







-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=



stand financial and operating disclosures; and







-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=



iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=



usly reported earnings.







We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=



 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.







Core Businesses







Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=



nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=



ese include:







-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;







-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;







-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and







-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.







The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=



r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=



me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=



 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=



.







I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =



of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =



concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=



mprovement in our counterparty relationships.







Non-Core Businesses







Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=



ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=



 return from them has been dismal.







We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =



that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=



 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=



ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=



ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=



G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=



s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=



 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.







Businesses Under Review







These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=



s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=



eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=



rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=



icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.







Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=



 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=



ecomes available.







Credit Rating/10-Q Filing







We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =



our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=



lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=



edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:







-- Moody's at Baa3       Under Review for Further Downgrade







-- Fitch at BBB-             Evolving Status







-- S&P at BBB-              CreditWatch Negative







We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=



 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=



0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =



19.







We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=



ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =



call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =



few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=



stors under SEC Filings.







=20







=20







In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =



joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=



n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=



xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=



 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=



curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=



us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =



Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=



ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=



e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=



o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=



, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =



507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Bu=



ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=



713) 646-3302.







In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=



dered participants in the solicitation of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=



n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=



irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=



le in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.
See how this looks.
OK thanks.  I'll presume its dead until I hear otherwise.

El Paso Corp. Absolved of Manipulation Charges (For Now),=20



But Affiliate Abuse Allegations Linger=20















By Will McNamara



Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20











  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>







[News item from Reuters] El Paso Corp. (NYSE: EPG) was cleared on Oct. 9 of=



 manipulating natural-gas prices in California, but the agency judge overse=



eing the case expressed impatience with company executives who engaged in w=



hat he described as hanky panky in arranging pipeline shipments. Curtis W=



agner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, ruled that El Paso did not un=



fairly drive up natural-gas prices on its four pipelines into energy-starve=



d California last year, but used blunt language in assessing the behavior o=



f two executives with the Houston-based energy giant. Wagner said telephone=



 records of the conversations showed blatant collusion between company af=



filiates in booking pipeline space at a discounted rate for future shipment=



s.=20







Analysis: The best assessment of this ruling in the ongoing case against El=



 Paso Corp. is that it is a mixed bag of judgments, and only one more step =



in what will continue to be a very long and drawn-out case. On one hand, th=



e FERC administrative law judge appears to be absolving El Paso Corp. of th=



e accusations that it intentionally manipulated conditions in California to=



 gain market power over the state's natural-gas market. That is the good ne=



ws for El Paso Corp. However, on the other hand, the same judge has also in=



tensified lingering claims that El Paso exclusively shared market-sensitive=



 information between its affiliates, violating a FERC standard of conduct t=



hat a pipeline must give information about natural-gas transportation to al=



l potential shippers as well as a company's own marketing affiliates. Furth=



er, as noted Judge Curtis Wagner has indicated that existing telephone reco=



rds from last year indicate blatant collusion between El Paso Corp. compa=



ny affiliates, potentially violating FERC rules that a pipeline's operating=



 staff and the staff of its marketing affiliate function independently of e=



ach other. The next step in this case will be to determine any possible fin=



es that might be affixed by the full FERC commission on the basis of the al=



leged collusion or affiliate abuse issues.=20







The case against El Paso Corp. is a very complicated one, but it essentiall=



y comes down to one core issue. The case revolves around allegations that d=



uring the period of May to November 2000 El Paso improperly shared market-s=



ensitive information with one of its affiliates, which drove up natural-gas=



 prices, pre-empted competition from non-affiliated companies and resulted =



in extra costs for fuel in the range of $3.7 billion for Californians. El P=



aso Corp. has consistently maintained that it engaged in no wrongdoing. The=



 case has carried enormous significance for the energy industry as it impac=



ts not only the profits earned by El Paso Corp. but also the degree to whic=



h federal regulators may continue to intercede into wholesale markets. In a=



ddition, the other key aspect to this case is the extent to which FERC, und=



er the leadership of new Chairman Pat Wood, will exhibit strong regulatory =



oversight over these claims of market abuse and issue its own harsh financi=



al penalties against El Paso Corp.=20







What is critically new about this case is the information now available fro=



m transcripts of phone conversations between El Paso affiliates. First, let=



 me establish some background that will help to explain the significance of=



 the transcripts. El Paso Corp. is the parent of subsidiaries El Paso Natur=



al Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy, which are the companies in question reg=



arding the California transactions. El Paso Natural Gas, a regulated compan=



y, operates pipelines and El Paso Merchant Energy, which is unregulated, ma=



rkets natural gas. El Paso Natural Gas owns and manages the Western Divisio=



n pipeline, which includes 14,604 miles of interstate transmission pipeline=



, serving markets in California, the southwestern United States, northern M=



exico, and throughout the Rocky Mountains. In early 2000, El Paso Natural G=



as awarded approximately one-third of the capacity on this interstate pipel=



ine to El Paso Merchant Energy. This contract essentially gave subsidiaries=



 of El Paso Corp. control over transporting about one-sixth of the state's =



daily demand in California. As such, this gave the El Paso affiliates betwe=



en 35 and 45 percent of the Southern California gas market, clearly positio=



ning it as the largest natural-gas provider in the state.=20







As subsidiaries, all of El Paso's operations fall under FERC's arms-length=



 rule, which enforces a separation between affiliated production and pipel=



ine companies that exist within a corporate family. Since early 2001, FERC =



has been examining allegations that El Paso manipulated natural-gas prices =



in California by blocking competitors' access to the interstate pipeline. C=



alifornia officials have claimed that El Paso subsidiaries secretly shared =



information about the pipeline that was not available to other companies. S=



pecifically, the transcripts of phone conversations between executives at E=



l Paso Merchant and Mojave Pipeline Co., an El Paso affiliate, reportedly i=



nclude comments from El Paso Merchant that inquire about a delay in publish=



ing information about the pipeline's available capacity to all potential co=



mpetitors.=20







The existence of these phone records gave some credence to ongoing claims t=



hat El Paso had shared what should have been public information only with i=



ts affiliates. According to Reuters, the executive at El Paso Merchant aske=



d the executive at Mojave Pipeline to hold off on posting competitive data =



about the capacity on the pipeline for a week. This allegation has importan=



t ramifications. First, the sharing of this non-public information might me=



an that El Paso's subsidiaries had provided preferential treatment to affil=



iated subsidiaries, which gave the company as a whole an unlawful advantage=



 over competitors. Any potential abuse of affiliate standards could include=



 the unlawful exchange of classified information between subsidiaries or th=



e extension of discounted prices between two affiliated companies. Yet, acc=



ording to Judge Wagner this sharing of information among affiliates did not=



 contribute to a clear case of market power abuse, and in fact should be di=



smissed outright, which is why the ruling is such a mixed bag for El Paso C=



orp.=20







Nevertheless, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), Pacific Ga=



s & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison may continue to fight the c=



ase with an appeal on the ruling that could be launched within 30 days. Acc=



ording to the California parties, this alleged manipulation cost California=



ns an extra $3.7 billion in unnecessary power purchase costs that the two u=



tilities are still attempting to recover. It is important to note that San =



Diego Gas & Electric, California's third IOU, purchases all of its natural-=



gas supply from Southern California Gas and is therefore not a participant =



in this case against El Paso.=20







In response, El Paso has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including market=



 manipulation or inappropriate sharing of information between its affiliate=



s, and thus has not violated any standards set out by FERC in its arms-len=



gth policy applied to affiliates. Instead, El Paso claims that the seeming=



ly high prices that it charged in California resulted solely from nationall=



y high gas prices. However, according to the Energy Information Administrat=



ion, delivery prices for natural gas in California during the October 2000 =



to January 2001 timeframe were considerably higher than other national mark=



ets. For instance, during this time period, natural-gas prices in Californi=



a were running near $23/MMBtu, while prices at Henry Hub and in Florida wer=



e at around $7/MMBtu.=20







El Paso says the sudden drop in natural-gas prices once its contract on the=



 pipeline expired is the result of constraints that are inherent in Califor=



nia's distribution system. In addition, the company claims that mild weathe=



r in the region and increased storage levels of natural gas have also drive=



n the dramatic price swing. Further, El Paso says that it hedged most of it=



s gas capacity into California to protect itself from potential losses, cut=



ting potential profits in the process. The significance of this, El Paso co=



ntends, is that the company's hedging indicates that it had no foreknowledg=



e that gas prices would be higher than normal. In other words, El Paso hedg=



ed on its gas supply because the company thought that prices would be flat =



or go down. On the other hand, hedging is a common practice among seasoned =



traders and gas traders have countered that hedged contracts are often reso=



ld at higher multiples before the gas is ultimately delivered.=20







It will be interesting to see where this case goes from here. As noted, the=



 new FERC that has emerged under the leadership of Pat Wood may demonstra=



te a decidedly lower tolerance for any allegations of affiliate abuse and c=



onsequently issue stiff penalties. In addition, it is interesting to note t=



hat other pending affiliate abuse cases have recently been launched by FERC=



, indicating that the commission is increasing its efforts to investigate s=



uch abuse. For instance, last week FERC ordered an inquiry into whether Exe=



lon Corp., PECO Energy and their affiliates improperly manipulated Northeas=



t power markets in 1999 by possibly sharing non-public information. Further=



, Wood has made no bones about the fact that he embraces a market philosoph=



y that includes regulatory intervention when necessary. Consequently, Wood =



could very well spearhead a re-examination of FERC's methodology regarding =



market-based rates in markets that become deregulated, along with how merch=



ant plants calculate their rates, and the ruling on potential fines against=



 El Paso Corp. could be the first indication of this policy change.=20

FYI - Pushing more Capex into 2002.
My concern is that what we are discussing would require the expenditure of funds of an extra $500K this year in order to move about $700 K of income to next year.    I would like to know what event in 2002 will allow us to create the income.   I believe based upon the contract, that the event has already taken place.    If someone can explain to me how this makes sense, I would like to hear it.

Chevron and Texaco Complete Merger, 

Creating Second Largest U.S. Energy Company 







By Christopher Perdue

Director, Market Research 





[News item from PR Newswire] Chevron Corp. announced today that stockholders have voted to approve the proposed merger with Texaco. The votes were cast at a special stockholder meeting. More than 441 million shares, 99 percent of the shares voted, approved the common stock issuance, and more than 438 million shares, 68 percent of the shares entitled to vote, approved the name change to ChevronTexaco Corporation. The companies intend to close the merger later today. 



Analysis: While the energy market has seen many deals this year, nothing matches the colossus created by this merger. The combination of San Francisco-based Chevron (NYSE: CHV) and White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco (NYSE:TX) creates a company with annual revenues of over $96 billion. In terms of market capitalization, the new company will rank second among U.S. energy companies with only Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) being larger. 



Chevron agreed to buy Texaco last October in a stock deal valued at approximately $39.3 billion, plus the assumption of about $6 billion in debt. Under the terms of the deal, Texaco shareholders receive .77 shares of Chevron common stock for each share of Texaco common stock they own, and Chevron shareholders will retain their existing shares. Chevron will be renamed ChevronTexaco and will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the new ticker symbol CVX. Next year, the new company will place its headquarters in suburban San Ramon, Calif. 



The new company will have reserves of 11.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), daily production of 2.7 million BOE, assets of $77 billion, and operations throughout the world. In the United States, ChevronTexaco will be the nation's third largest producer of oil and gas, with production of 1.1 million BOE per day, and will hold the nation's third largest reserve position, with 4.2 billion BOE of proven reserves. 



The approval from shareholders represents the final hurdle to the merger. European regulators have already granted approval, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) voted 4-0 to approve the merger last month. Chevron and Texaco also recently negotiated a consent decree with the attorneys general of 12 states. 



To satisfy the FTC's apprehension that the merger, as initially proposed, would violate antitrust law, Texaco agreed to divest its U.S. refining and marketing affiliates. 



Texaco refines crude oil in the United States under two separate affiliates, Equilon Enterprises and Motiva Enterprises. The company owns a 44-percent interest in Equilon, with the remainder belonging to Shell. Texaco and Saudi Refining each own 35 percent of Motiva. The rest is owned by Shell. 



In addition, Texaco will sell its one-third interest in the Discovery natural-gas pipeline system in the Gulf of Mexico and its general aviation businesses in 14 states. 



Although Texaco and Chevron have been rivals, the two companies have a long business relationship. For the past 65 years, they have co-owned a prosperous joint venture called Caltex, which sells 1.8 million barrels of crude oil and petroleum products per day with operations in 60 countries. Caltex refines crude oil and marketing petroleum products, LNG and gas products with a workforce of more than 6,000. Revenues for the company and its affiliates were $20.2 billion in 2000. 



This merger appears to be a good fit for many reasons. One benefit is that the two companies have many complementary operations internationally, including West Africa and Brazil, home to some of the world's largest new oil fields. 



The new company will have a leadership position in power generation. Texaco's power and gasification business, with equity interests in 3,500 megawatts of power operating or under construction, and Chevron's 26-percent stake in Dynegy, Inc., will strengthen the company's position in the gasification and power generation markets. 



In addition, the sheer size of the new company should allow it to better cope with fluctuating crude prices and provide a greater ability to undertake global projects that are growing in complexity, size and cost. The stock market attests to these economies of scale. The stock prices for Chevron and Texaco, though up about 50 percent and 60 percent over the past five years, have under-performed those of the gargantuan players like ExxonMobil and BP. After gaining enormous size through mergers in recent years, these two companies have seen their shares return about 70 percent and 80 percent, respectively. 



ExxonMobil and BP have seen their price/earnings multiples command significant premiums as well. Chevron and Texaco currently have price/earnings multiples of about 9.2 and 12.3 respectively, while BP and ExxonMobil command price/earnings multiples of approximately 15.1 and 16.3 respectively. 



These significant stock price premiums that ExxonMobil and BP have obtained after their mergers bode nicely for ChevronTexaco. It now joins the ranks of these major players. As mentioned earlier, in terms of market capitalization, the new company will rank second among U.S. energy companies, and fourth among global energy companies, with a market capitalization approaching $100 billion. 



The new company expects to reduce costs by at least $1.2 billion per year within six to nine months of the merger's completion. The most significant savings (approximately $700 million) are projected to come from more efficient exploration and production activities. An additional $300 million is expected to come from the consolidation of corporate functions, and $200 million from other operations. The company anticipates that the combined workforce of about 57,000 will be reduced by approximately 7 percent worldwide. 



These projected expense reductions of $1.2 billion could be just an initial payoff. Looking at the recent mergers of BP and ExxonMobil, history suggests that the major oil companies underestimate their scope for slashing costs. For example, since the merger of Exxon and Mobil in 1999, savings estimates have been raised by about $1 billion in each of the years 2000 to 2002. In addition, BP has almost doubled initial savings expectations in its various mergers to $4 billion from $2.2 billion. So, it is not inconceivable that the merger could reduce costs perhaps up to twice as much as currently projected, and that would translate into earnings for next year and beyond being much higher than anticipated. 



The creation of ChevronTexaco adds a new player to the oil and gas elite. Rather than being acquired by ExxonMobil Corp., BP Amoco Plc, or Royal Dutch Shell Group, as was becoming more likely with each passing month, Chevron and Texaco became their equal.

As I mentioned to you last week, there are currently about 50 EBS employees who are exempt from the Enron e-mail retention policy.  These individuals were exempted from the e-mail retention policy in order to preserve documents related to the Blockbuster litigation.  Now that the Blockbuster litigation is over, there is no reason for these individuals to continue to be exempt from the e-mail retention policy.  I propose sending the following  e-mail to the currently exempt EBS employees:



_____________



For the past several months, because of the necessity to preserve documents relating to the Blockbuster litigation, you have been exempted from Enron's e-mail retention policy.  The Blockbuster litigation has now concluded.  Therefore, beginning Monday, October 15, 2001, you will be subject to the e-mail retention policy.  As a reminder, that policy provides as follows:



Message Location - Maximum Retention

Inbox - 30 days

Sent Mail Folder - 30 days

Trash/Deleted Items - Rollover from Inbox for one day

Folders - All Email messages placed in folders will be destroyed after one calendar year. This includes public folders in Outlook.

Furthermore, it is against policy to store Email outside of your Outlook Mailbox and/or your Public Folders.  Please do not copy Email onto floppy disks, zip disks, CDs or the network.  Such actions are prohibited and will not be supported by the IT Department.



There will be no exceptions to this policy.

Tracy,

Is there such a thing that we need to do for you.  If yes, could I get the template from you.  I don't think our G&A will change.  Thanks.
For the avoidance of doubt, I am resending the Disclosure letter to West LB that was distributed last night [it went to a smaller distribution list]. As previously noted, the Disclosure letter reflects the facts as of today, and must be reviewed in consideration of the circumstances if intended to be used at a later date.

Here's the information.
Below are the arrival and departure dates that I have reserved for you at the San Luis Resort in Galveston for the 2nd Annual Accounting Leadership Conference.



    Arrival             Departure

    9/19                9/21





The 2nd Annual Accounting Leadership Conference has been scheduled for September 20-21, 2001 at the San Luis Resort in Galveston.   In addition to communication and networking, this year the focus of the conference will be on leadership:

    refining the direction and objectives for Global Accounting

    defining and agreeing on priorities

    improving leadership skills 



In addition, the format of the conference has changed from last year.

  

The conference will be more participatory.  While there will be a few speakers/presentations, you will spend more time in working sessions focused on the topics above. 



The meeting will begin at 9AM on Thursday.  The meeting should adjourn by 3:00 on Friday.  There is no organized dinner or activity for Wednesday night.



The San Luis Resort is located at 5222 Seawall Boulevard, Galveston, Texas.

Here is a draft LOU and termsheet from the transaction in which we acquired an interest in oil and gas properties (this is somewhat related to the deal described in the documents that I just sent to you).  It is probably more appropriate for a transaction in which we are acquiring a direct interest in oil and gas properties.

For all concerned:    We will only have 2 hours to cover a wide range of topics and Tracy will be working with Stan on the time allotments and expected content.   She will be getting back in touch with you after our more detailed reviews with Stan, scheduled for Oct 11th (PGE) and Oct 12th (ETS & EREC) to begin to get the actual presentations set up.    If anyone believes they need some one else to attend this planned review meeting with Ken Lay for support or other purposes, please let me know.
The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.



No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.



We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

Williams and Duke Commence Construction



of Gulfstream Project=20















By Will McNamara



Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20











  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>







[News item from Business Wire] Gulfstream National Gas System announced tod=



ay that it has received Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approva=



l to commence mainline pipeline construction in Florida. With this approval=



, Gulfstream now has all the major segments of its 753-mile pipeline projec=



t under construction and on schedule to deliver natural gas in June 2002.=



=20







Analysis: The Gulfstream Natural Gas System, which is by far the largest pi=



peline project in the Southeast, has been designed specifically to deliver =



natural gas into the Florida wholesale market. When finished, the project r=



eportedly will be the largest natural-gas pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico, w=



ith capacity to transport approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural g=



as per day, and the first new transportation system to serve Florida in mor=



e than 40 years. Williams (NYSE: WMB) and Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) jointly o=



wn the pipeline, having purchased it from Coastal Corp. last year, a sale t=



hat was made possible due to regulatory requirements surrounding Coastal's =



merger with El Paso Corp. Along with projects still being led by El Paso Co=



rp. (NYSE: EPG), the Gulfstream project highlights the continuing emphasis =



on pipeline construction, which by some accounts is experiencing the larges=



t wave of expansion since the early 1960s.=20







Williams and Duke have provided a current status report regarding construct=



ion of the pipeline, including notice that more than 200 of the 431 miles o=



f offshore pipeline have been laid in the Gulf of Mexico. Gulfstream also h=



as already laid pipe in parts of Florida and Alabama, some of the more sens=



itive regions along the pipeline's path.=20







Like other pipeline developments, the Gulfstream project, the construction =



for which began on June 1, 2001, is being driven by several factors, includ=



ing demand (which for the most part remains strong), the prominence of natu=



ral gas as the fuel source for new power plants and a presidential administ=



ration that is supportive of production. What is perhaps most interesting a=



bout the boom in pipeline construction is that many of the same companies t=



hat own or control natural-gas supplies are also quickly acquiring or partn=



ering with other firms that specialize in pipeline construction.=20







For background, subsidiaries of Duke Energy and Williams announced their in=



tent to jointly purchase Coastal Corp.'s 100-percent interest in the Gulfst=



ream Natural Gas System project in November 2000. The project was originall=



y sponsored by a subsidiary of Coastal Corp., a $16 billion Houston-based e=



nergy holding company with operations in natural-gas production, distributi=



on and marketing. However, due to regulatory mandates related to Coastal Co=



rp.'s merger with El Paso Energy Corp., Coastal Corp. was forced by the Fed=



eral Trade Commission to divest the project. As a result, Duke Energy and W=



illiams found a good window of opportunity to purchase the pipeline project=



 and its valuable inroad to the Florida market.=20







Approximately 400 miles of the route, which originates in Mobile, Ala., cro=



sses the Gulf of Mexico and will be located in federal offshore waters. Gul=



fstream offers 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural-gas capacity per day, and =



is designed to primarily serve Florida utilities and power-generation facil=



ities that plan on using high-efficiency natural-gas turbines. Already, the=



 project has precedent agreements with 10 large Florida utilities and power=



 generation facilities.=20







Duke and Williams have agreed to jointly manage the operation and developme=



nt of the Gulfstream project. It's not difficult to assess why Duke and Wil=



liams would be willing to co-own the project. The two companies, which have=



 historically had a collaborative relationship, already own significant amo=



unts of interstate natural-gas pipeline capacity. Between its two subsidiar=



ies involved in natural-gas production-Duke Energy Field Services and Duke =



Energy Gas Transmission-Duke Energy owns and operates about 57,000 miles of=



 pipeline and 12,000 interstate miles of capacity. Williams' five interstat=



e natural-gas pipelines reportedly deliver about 16 percent of the natural =



gas consumed in the United States. The company's vast 27,300-mile pipeline =



network stretches from coast to coast and from Mexico to Canada, serving mo=



re than 48 million residential, commercial and industrial natural-gas users=



. In fact, the two companies already were planning the Buccaneer Gas Pipeli=



ne project in Florida, a 674-mile pipeline that would have followed a simil=



ar route as the Gulfstream project will follow. Duke and Williams are no lo=



nger planning the Buccaneer project now that they have acquired the Gulfstr=



eam project. The addition of Gulfstream should benefit both companies and o=



ffer a prime position for them to expand their independent operations in Fl=



orida.=20







The CEO of Williams' gas pipeline group stated that the Florida market woul=



d support only one new pipeline coming into the state. By joining together,=



 Williams and Duke can both capitalize on the high-growth state as it event=



ually becomes competitive. First among the priorities for the project is to=



 ensure adequate pipeline capacity by June 2002, and meeting the projected =



10,000-MW electric generation growth that is expected in the state of Flori=



da by 2007.=20







Duke Energy also confirmed that the purchase of the Gulfstream project acce=



lerates its own entry into Florida. In fact, Richard Priory, Duke's CEO, co=



nceded at a conference last year that Duke's future success would result fr=



om its natural-gas operations. Specifically, Duke has been focused on merch=



ant plant and natural-gas pipeline construction for some time. As of this s=



ummer, Duke was rated third in announced merchant plants (behind Calpine an=



d Panda), and has made no bones about the fact that its strategy is centere=



d around building additional merchant plants and acquiring natural-gas pipe=



lines. Thus, the acquisition of Gulfstream is a perfectly appropriate move =



for the company to make.=20







Most projections place natural gas as the ongoing fuel of choice for new ge=



neration as the demand for natural gas is expected to increase from 23 tril=



lion to 30 trillion cubic feet per year by 2010. In addition, coal and nucl=



ear generation came under environmental and public scrutiny over the last t=



wo decades, at a time when natural-gas prices were comparatively low. All o=



f these factors have created a strong market for natural-gas generation.=20







Duke has had a rather difficult time penetrating the Florida market, so thi=



s pipeline could facilitate easier expansion in the state. About a year ago=



, the Florida Public Service Commission had approved the construction of a =



Duke merchant plant in New Smyrna Beach. However, the state's three IOUs ap=



pealed the decision to the Florida Supreme Court, arguing that merchant pla=



nts were not allowed under state law. The Florida Supreme Court overturned =



the decision of the state PSC, blocking Duke's entry into the state. Conseq=



uently, Duke is wisely using the acquisition of the Gulfstream project as a=



nother way to get into the Florida market (and one that is potentially more=



 profitable).=20







Along with Duke and Williams, El Paso Energy Corp. also is focused on build=



ing and acquiring new pipeline capacity. The company is the parent of subsi=



diaries El Paso Natural Gas, a regulated company that operates pipelines, a=



nd El Paso Merchant Energy, an unregulated company that markets natural gas=



. El Paso Natural Gas owns and manages the Western Division pipeline, which=



 includes 14,604 miles of interstate pipeline, serving markets in Californi=



a, the southwestern United States and throughout the Rocky Mountains. In fa=



ct, El Paso owns and operates the largest natural-gas pipeline in North Ame=



rica, totaling more than 58,000 miles of pipeline reaching all the major gr=



owth areas in this country.=20

Spain's Endesa Moves In for a U.S. Acquisition=20















By Will McNamara



Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20











  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>







[News report from Power Finance & Risk] Endesa, Spain's largest utility, is=



 setting up a business development unit in New York and will shortly transf=



er three executives from its Madrid headquarters to seek out investment opp=



ortunities in the United States. Virginia Sanz de Madrid, a Spanish utility=



 analyst at Deutsche Bank in Madrid, says Endesa is probably looking to acq=



uire existing generation or distribution companies rather than develop new =



assets from scratch. She adds that Endesa is looking to spend some $2 to $3=



 billion to enter the U.S. energy market.=20







Analysis: A common response to reports that Endesa is attempting to expand =



in the United States may be: Why has the company waited so long? Along with=



 affording new opportunities for domestic companies, deregulation of the U.=



S. electric market has also enticed several large European power firms to e=



xpand their scales through a stateside acquisition. Thus, some financial an=



alysts may wonder if Endesa is jumping on the U.S.-expansion bandwagon too =



late. The timing may still be right for Endesa, however, considering that f=



alling wholesale electricity prices across the United States and the decrea=



sed value of generation assets over the last few months could actually make=



 a U.S. generation purchase more lucrative today than in recent years. Cons=



equently, Endesa's rumored expansion efforts in the United States, and cont=



inuing acquisitions across continental Europe, are part of the company's ag=



gressive growth strategy.=20







Under the monopoly system in Spain, Endesa was clearly the country's larges=



t power firm, owning about 22,576 MW of generating capacity and controlling=



 67 percent of Spain's electricity market. However, due to its own move tow=



ard privatization, the Spanish government has placed restrictions on the do=



mestic growth of the country's largest electric companies, requiring Endesa=



 to look abroad for growth opportunities. Thus, for some time there has bee=



n little question that Endesa would like to develop interests across contin=



ental Europe, and is not going to let any dust settle before it continues t=



o expand. The fact that Endesa also plans to expand in the United States re=



presents a new, but not necessarily surprising, direction for the company.=



=20







The impetus for Endesa moving into the United States, beyond the opportunit=



ies for growth that exist in this country, may be rooted in some setbacks t=



hat Endesa has experienced in Spain and minimal acquisition opportunities a=



cross continental Europe. In late 2000, Endesa made its first significant m=



ove outside of Spain when it purchased a 30-percent interest in the French =



electricity generator Societe Nationale d'Electricite et de Thermique (SNET=



). While a comparatively small company by American standards, SNET is the s=



econd-largest electricity company in France in terms of installed capacity,=



 and third largest in terms of electricity generation. SNET owns five coal =



plants totaling 2,600 megawatts, which generate about 6,838 GWh annually. T=



his is a very low output, and in fact SNET accounts for only 2.5 percent of=



 the market share in France. However, given the fact that France's largest =



energy company, EDF, still has a hold on about 90 percent of the market in =



the country, the acquisition of the next-largest company was a major coup. =



The acquisition of SNET was also attractive to Endesa because of the compan=



y's experience in coal-based electricity-which still is the power source fo=



r roughly half of the electricity produced across the Continent-and its pro=



gressiveness in terms of technology.=20







Upon the acquisition of SNET, Endesa began friendly merger proceedings with=



 Iberdrola, the second-largest power firm in Spain. Under the now-terminate=



d deal, Endesa would have purchased Iberdrola for about $12.6 billion and c=



reated a new entity well prepared to expand across Europe and Latin America=



. Reportedly, the merger would have created the world's third-biggest elect=



ricity company, after Tokyo Electric Power and Enron, and without question =



would have marked Spain's largest industrial merger to date. For further pe=



rspective, the new company created by the merger between Endesa and Iberdro=



la would have had a combined market capitalization of approximately 36 bill=



ion euros (or $32 billion in U.S. terms). This would have surpassed Duke En=



ergy's market capitalization of $30.3 billion and been roughly the size of =



American Electric Power, TXU, and Reliant put together (resulting in a $33.=



8 million market capitalization). Had it materialized, the merger also woul=



d have given a considerable jolt to Spain's fast-growing power market, and =



altered the current playing field among Europe's largest power companies.=



=20







However, in a major setback for Endesa's growth, Spanish authorities requir=



ed that the merged company sell off some generating capacity, arguing that =



Spain needed new players to increase competition. The government also ruled=



 that the new entity would have to lower its market share of distribution, =



and authorities cut the amount of stranded costs that the new company would=



 be able to recoup. Although analysts had expected the merger to proceed de=



spite the government conditions, Endesa and Iberdrola said the imposed gove=



rnmental conditions outweighed the benefits of the merger, which would crea=



te fewer synergies than initially proposed. Ironically, much of the funding=



 for Endesa's purchases have come from the sales of its own non-strategic a=



ssets that took place in preparation for the Iberdrola acquisition.=20







Moreover, the inability to grow its scale through the purchase of Iberdrola=



 has apparently prompted Endesa to concentrate on finding new acquisition o=



pportunities. In addition to expansion into the United States, last month E=



ndesa led a consortium that will acquire the generation assets of Enel, Ita=



ly's largest generating company, for 2.63 billion euros. The generating ass=



ets, which are housed under a subsidiary company known as Elettrogen, inclu=



de an installed capacity of 5,700 MW that is ranked as the second-largest g=



enerating firm in Italy. Elettrogen is one of three companies in which Enel=



 grouped its generation assets in order to comply with Italian regulatory m=



andates regarding divestiture. The purchase of Elettrogen marks the first s=



ignificant expansion of Endesa beyond its home territory in Spain. In the p=



urchase agreement, Endesa will have 45-percent ownership of Elettrogen, par=



tnering with Banco Santander Central Hispano (40 percent), a Spanish bank, =



and Italian ASM Brescia (15 percent), a municipal utility that serves 400,0=



00 customers in Italy.=20







The acquisition of Elettrogen is an important component of Endesa's expansi=



on strategy across Europe and may be an indication of how the company inten=



ds to progress in the United States. Endesa has established a goal of accum=



ulating 8,000 MW of generating capacity beyond its existing assets in Spain=



 by 2005. Through the purchase of Elettrogen and the previous purchase of S=



NET, Endesa has already reached that goal four years ahead of schedule.=20







If Endesa does make a purchase of a U.S. company, it will most likely be an=



 acquisition that involves substantial generating assets, as power generati=



on has become Endesa's primary focus. To date, there have been a handful of=



 instances in which an international power firm has bought a U.S. energy co=



mpany since deregulation began four years ago. ScottishPower purchased Paci=



fiCorp, National Grid purchased New England Electric System (NEES) and East=



ern Utilities Associates (EUA), and Powergen bought LG&E. Note that all of =



these buying companies are based in the United Kingdom. Pending internation=



al deals include National Grid's purchase of Niagara Mohawk and the German =



company RWE's purchase of American Water Works, and EDF has made it clear t=



hat it also wants to expand in the United States. Generally speaking, inter=



national power firms have used the purchase of either vertically integrated=



 utilities or unbundled businesses as a testing ground to learn the ins a=



nd outs of the U.S. energy market and plan subsequent specialization in a p=



articular market niche. Further, although international companies such as N=



ational Grid are focused on the transmission side of the U.S. energy indust=



ry, the generation sector clearly offers solid opportunities for growth. In=



 the spring of 2001, President Bush released an energy plan that calls for =



significant new energy production efforts, which opened up new windows of o=



pportunity for international companies to further expand in the United Stat=



es.=20

? 2001 Terrapinn Pty Ltd.
The attached spreadsheet shows the quarterly reclasses between O&M and COGS for Transwestern for the year 2000.  As we discussed, we are very supportive of making this 2000 reclass in order to avoid having to explain large year to year variances caused only by the re-mapping. It will also conform Enron's reporting to TW's stand-alone GAAP reporting for 2000.  Please call if you have any questions.



Thanks for helping us make this happen.
Here is the most recently updated 2002 Plan file.  Look under the Summary tab.
This is the oldest of the 2002 files.  Again, look at the Summary tab.
Mark,

Please review the attached listing and advise if you agree to the projects and amounts listed as billings that Enron North America will receive in 2002 for support of these efforts. I'm at x30352 if you have any questions. Thanks!
I have now spoken with the following people in doing further due diligence:



    1.  Theresa Bushman.  Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Mariner's GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner for the time being, given F&J's knowledge of Mariner's corporate history.  Theresa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond.



    2.   Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC.  Kelly advised me recently that she has a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to handle, subject to your approval.  Kelly told me that she would be contacting you about this.



    3.   Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law.   John has given me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as recommendations.  In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate client solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse to that client in the future.  John thinks it might be appropriate to ask for a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances.



    4.  Uriel Dutton.  Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsidiaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned on the following:



    a.  F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on  one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the Method and System for the Determination of VAR).



    b.  F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial.



    c.  Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our consideration.   We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this matter early next week.  Although Dutton will be out of the office next week, he will be reachable by cell phone.



    Proposed going forward strategy:



    Chuck and I suggest that if an acceptable waiver letter can be fashioned, that we proceed with proposal offered by F&J.  We invite comments.



    Britt
We've updated the Merger Q&A document on our Enron Updates site ( <http://home.enron.com/updates/mergerQA.html>), as a result of the many questions you've had concerning the merger between Enron and Dynegy. Questions addressed include those about Enron stock options, benefits and immigration status. Please stay tuned for additional updates.
Ray, I am not sure how this reasonable and prudent request could in any way be interpreted as a threat, and therefore do not understand.  On the contrary, to sweep the accounts without the input of the Directors of these companies threatens the individuals with substantial personal liability. Further, to simply request the agreement of the three individuals who are the Directors of these companies is not onerous, and is consistent with their good faith attempts to discharge their fiduciary obligations as Directors.  Unfortunately, these fiduciary obligations do not recognize the administrative efficiencies of Enron's cash management systems.  If this remains unsatisfactory, please let me know by return.

Care has to be taken as to what constitutes an acceptable waiver letter, and if it is too broad (e.g., gives them anything in the way of being able to take sides against us on a matter on which they have done work for us) it would be unacceptable.

here it is!
Due to a number extenuating circumstances, the deadline for completion of final allocations has been changed from this Friday, September 14th, to next Wednesday, September 19th.  I have attached an updated list of Key Dates for the 2002 Plan.  Please note that no other dates have been adjusted.  The due date for the full plan remains Thursday, October 4th.



Additionally, the Plan format files (in excel form) that are scheduled to be distributed on September 20 per the plan calendar will likely be distributed tomorrow.  It would be beneficial if you or your designee could attend the Adaytum user group meeting tomorrow, as Greg Adams and I will be discussing what is in the file and we will be reviewing the Plan Excel/Adaytum strategy going forward.



Thanks,

Steve
This is calculated using, form the NBP 2000 10-K:

Net income+ minority interest in net income + interest expense, net - equity AFUDC.



    $196.0 million



This is not a number we generally use.  We always include EBITDA in our press releases.  Just FYI, EBITDA for 2000 was $259.0 million and, in addition to the above, is adjusted by depreciation and amortization and goodwill amortization
Rod wanted me to point out to you that NNG IT would be spending an additional $4.9 of capital in 2001 with approximately $4.2 spent in Nov.  This is reflected on the 2001 Capital by month schedules I sent you.  Stan had approved $9.0, but IT was able to negotiate their cost down to the $4.9.   The dollars will be spent on purchasing the SAN (Storage Area Network) equipment.  This $4.9 was not in the 2001 capital budget nor reflected in any other quarterly or current estimates.   cvb

***PORTAL DISCUSSION***

Our current topic is 'Back door laws: will they work?'

One reader has stated:

This is and always will be a bad idea. Commerce needs the strongest possible encryption that is practical. Limiting encryption strength and putting in back doors is bad for business. With more and more commerce happening on the Internet, the only way forward is strong encryption and user authentication.



Speak up - or else you will never be heard!

Munipalization Vote in San Francisco May Set Precedent















By Will McNamara



Director, Electric Industry Analysis











[News item from Associated Press] In the wake of this year's California pow=



er woes, votes in the hometown of the state's largest utility will decide o=



n Nov. 6 whether to initiate action to seize Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s l=



ocal electricity network and deliver power through a public agency.=20







Analysis: There is a lot riding on today's vote, and its outcome will undou=



btedly have significant ramifications for California and other cities acros=



s the country. Although the municipalization of an incumbent utility's elec=



tric system is not a new concept-either nationally or in this particular ca=



se-San Francisco is presently the largest city in which such efforts are be=



ing considered. Given the relative success of other municipalized electric =



systems in California (Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Sacram=



ento Municipal Utility District, for instance), along with the bad publicit=



y that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has encountered over the last year due to=



 the state's energy crisis and its own bankruptcy proceedings, today's vote=



 could very well be a victory for public power. The vote in and of itself w=



ill not create a municipalized electric system in San Francisco. Pacific Ga=



s & Electric Co. has already vowed to fight the takeover, and if the vote i=



s a win for public power it will only lead to further lengthy and costly co=



urt battles. However, the vote is significant because it illustrates what a=



ppears to be a growing trend among cities that believe they can provide che=



aper electric service than incumbent, for-profit utilities. In addition, th=



e measure is just one more strike against the already beleaguered Pacific G=



as & Electric Co., which is still navigating through bankruptcy proceedings=



.=20







There are two measures related to the public power movement that are up for=



 vote in San Francisco today. First, Proposition I would create a San Franc=



isco-Brisbane Municipal Utility District (MUD), an independent agency gover=



ned by a five-member board that would provide electric service to San Franc=



isco and Brisbane, Calif., a smaller city located to the south of the Bay A=



rea. California law requires that two separate cities be included in order =



for municipalization to take effect, and thus from the onset of the municip=



alization discussions in this area San Francisco and Brisbane were grouped =



together as one district. The second measure up for vote, known as Proposit=



ion F, would create a Water and Power Agency in San Francisco only and reta=



in ties to City Hall. This measure would not create a MUD and therefore wou=



ld not need to include Brisbane to take effect. The agency would be governe=



d by an elected seven-member board of directors and would replace the curre=



nt jurisdictional oversight by the California Public Utilities Commission.=



=20







An affirmative vote in either or both of the measures would not necessarily=



 mean an immediate effort to take over Pacific Gas & Electric's infrastruct=



ure. In addition to the court appeals that would undoubtedly take place, in=



 the event of either measure being passed an elected board would have to su=



bsequently vote whether or not to seize the utility's transmission and dist=



ribution lines. If such a vote were approved, the MUD could use eminent dom=



ain to take over the utility's assets.=20







Ultimately at stake is a battle over Pacific Gas & Electric's 4.7 million c=



ustomers and its transmission system, which has been appraised between $750=



 million and $1 billion (the utility claims that its system is worth $1.5 b=



illion). Both sides have argued decidedly different platforms. The pro-muni=



 effort in San Francisco / Brisbane has been led by Bruce Brugmann, the pub=



lisher of the Bay Guardian newspaper and City Supervisors Angela Alioto and=



 Tom Ammiano. The proponents of the muni measure argue that a utility distr=



ict operating as a nonprofit public entity would be more beneficial to city=



 residents than a dividend-paying division of a major energy firm. It has b=



een repeatedly noted by the pro-muni forces that Pacific Gas & Electric Co.=



 charges the third-highest electric rates in the United States. In addition=



, the proponents point to already-established municipalized districts in Ca=



lifornia such as LADWP and SMUD, which they claim have protected customers =



from increasingly volatile prices for electricity. The other tenets of the =



pro-muni argument are that public power would lead to better accountability=



 to customers and more emphasis on renewable energy.=20







The movement against the muni effort is obviously led by Pacific Gas & Elec=



tric Co., but also includes officials from AT&T and Pacific Telesis Group, =



which together contributed about $250,000 to the opposition effort. Apparen=



tly, local communications companies fear that a successful municipalization=



 effort of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. would lead to similar takeover measur=



es in the phone industry. The basic argument against the public power movem=



ent is that the plan is unrealistic. Specifically, opponents say, the MUD f=



ormed by San Francisco and Brisbane would be ill-equipped to handle the com=



plex electricity infrastructure that Pacific Gas & Electric has effectively=



 managed for years, and that a city-run bureaucracy would not be able to co=



mpete with big league energy players. In addition, the new MUD would have t=



o purchase Pacific Gas & Electric's transmission assets and also buy wholes=



ale power without the benefit of long-term contracts, which represent two h=



efty investments that would end up costing consumers in the long run. It is=



 true that the city of San Francisco owns the dam at Hetch Hetchy reservoir=



, which powers street lights and city offices with hydropower. However, the=



 reservoir is reportedly in great need for maintenance and may require addi=



tional capital for upgrades. Thus, in order to serve Pacific Gas & Electric=



's 4.7 million customers, the MUD would have to buy most of its power on th=



e wholesale market.=20







This is actually one of several important points that may not have been tak=



en into full consideration by the pro-muni forces. Already-established MUDs=



 in California such as LADWP and SMUD, and those in other states, have alre=



ady established lucrative contracts to obtain federal power at cheap rates =



through 2004. There is a good chance that a San Francisco / Brisbane MUD wo=



uld not have the same opportunity to secure the same rates at this juncture=



. Thus, without the benefit of long-term contracts, the San Francisco / Bri=



sbane MUD could be exposed to the volatile wholesale market or be forced to=



 invest in the construction of expensive power plants. Often, such costs ge=



t overlooked when a city is planning to municipalize. In fact, it has been =



reported that the pro-muni side in this particular case did not conduct any=



 feasibility study in advance of its campaign, and thus could very well be =



unaware of these associated costs. However, S. David Freeman, who previousl=



y managed LADWP and was recently appointed chairman of the new California C=



onsumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority, went on record stating =



that his organization could assist a public power agency in San Francisco b=



y selling it low-cost electricity produced by plants financed by the author=



ity.=20







As noted, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. intends to fight the municipalization =



effort, and in fact has fought in City Hall and in court for decades to der=



ail such efforts in San Francisco. However, in contrast with past battles, =



the issue has become more intensely politicized over the last year as San F=



ranciscans faced rolling blackouts and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. went bank=



rupt. The utility recently received cash support from its parent PG&E Corp.=



, which reportedly spent about $1 million in an advertising campaign urging=



 citizens to vote against the public power initiative. This financial suppo=



rt has been helpful, considering that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is current=



ly in bankruptcy proceedings and has little capital to front its own defens=



e against the muni effort. Consequently, if voters pass the measures on Nov=



. 6, PG&E Corp. will undoubtedly launch a lengthy court battle that will ke=



ep the issue in litigation for years. In addition to the court appeals, it =



would most likely take the newly formed MUD years to gather the capital nee=



ded to front a purchase of Pacific Gas & Electric's T&D assets.=20







Nevertheless, an affirmative vote on the muni issue could set a precedent f=



or future votes and perhaps mark the dawn of a new era for public power. Ot=



her California cities such as San Diego, San Jose and Davis are closely fol=



lowing the outcome in San Francisco as they have also debated the issue of =



municipalization. In addition, the Coachella Valley Association of Governme=



nts, which includes the city of Palm Springs, Calif., began looking at the =



feasibility of taking over Southern California Edison's distribution system=



 and forming a municipal utility last September. In fact, the municipalizat=



ion effort has gained some momentum across the country over the last few ye=



ars, along with the opening of competitive markets through deregulation. Cu=



rrent reports indicate that there are about 2,000 public electric districts=



, providing electric power to 40 million customers and accounting for 15 pe=



rcent of the demand in the United States. It is important to note that the =



majority of these public power districts were formed in the early 1900s.=20







The turnout for the vote in San Francisco could be a deciding factor. Altho=



ugh the issue had been gaining momentum in the city earlier this year, the =



events of Sept. 11 have turned the focus to more national events and made p=



eople wary of change. Typically, voter turnout in the area is around 35 per=



cent. A recent survey conducted by the opponents of the measure found that =



35 percent of those surveyed favored passage, 30 percent oppose it, and 35 =



percent were undecided.=20







It is important to note that municipalization is not an issue that is only =



facing California. After several years of discussions, lawsuits and negotia=



tions, the city of Hermiston, Ore., voted to spend $8 million to purchase t=



he facilities PacifiCorp has been using to serve 4,000 commercial and resid=



ential customers. The city of Hermiston began serving customers on Oct. 1, =



when a new contract with Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) took effect.=



 The federal power-marketing agency has already set aside 12 MW for the cit=



y, after determining that Hermiston qualified as a new small public utility=



 eligible for preference power.=20







Hermiston, Ore., is the first city to complete a contested municipalization=



 of an incumbent utility's electric business in two decades (the last signi=



ficant contested municipalization was completed in Massena, N.Y., in 1981).=



 Despite the fact that a growing number of U.S. cities have expressed inter=



est in municipalizing their electric systems, for the most part such effort=



s remain overwhelmingly unsuccessful when taken to court or a public ballot=



. Despite the success of Hermiston, some 50 other municipalization efforts =



have been terminated during the 30 years between 1970 and 2000. For instanc=



e, the city of Wichita, Kansas, spent more than $300,000 in the past two ye=



ars studying municipal power options. However, after the Kansas Corporation=



 Commission turned down Western Resources' proposed rate hike this summer, =



the city put municipalization plans on hold. Thus, the eyes of the industry=



 will remain on the vote today in San Francisco for any indication that mun=



icipalization efforts are gaining momentum and proving successful.=20







TOMORROW'S ISSUEALERT WILL INCLUDE THE OUTCOME OF THE MUNICIPALIZATION VOTE=



 IN SAN FRANCISCO.=20

Pipeline integrity and safety have risen to new levels of public concern.  In the aftermath of the incidents at Bellingham, Washington and Carlsbad, New Mexico new pipeline safety regulations and legislation will require increased focus on pipeline integrity programs.  As a proactive approach to address these concerns, ETS Operations is establishing a Pipeline Integrity Program Management Group.  This group will be responsible for pipeline integrity issues for EOTT and ETS and financial reporting of EOTT's environmental and remediation projects.  The group will include the following functions:  corrosion, pipeline safety and pipeline integrity.  

 

I am pleased to announce that Mike Nelson will relocate to Houston to lead this new initiative, as Vice President Pipeline Integrity Program Management.  Reporting directly to Mike are Max Brown and Dave Johnson.  

 

The establishment of this new function, along with Mike's move, has given us the opportunity to rotate key staff, allowing us to achieve a broader knowledge base for the future of ETS Operations.  I am pleased to announce the following additional changes:

Please set up a meeting.
Thanks Tracy - I'll let everyone know....



>>> Geaccone, Tracy 09/14/01 09:48AM >>>
We may have a problem here.    Tracy, make sure Karl is aware of the change in the schedule here.
Two issues: First,should we pay the law firms? Total is 43mm. Second, Lisa and I think that the group needs some direction today. Can we have a 10-15min telephone call at 4:45 or after the Board meeting (6:00)
Per your request, historical California throughput data for TW and competitive pipelines.
Here is the attached spreadsheet showing the variances of the Revised PAF compared to the Original PAF for the Beatrice Trailblazer to C Line (C.014625).  As we discussed, it appears likely that there will be savings from other parts of the total project (on the TW side) that can be used to cover the increased costs.  I propose we revise this particular PAF number to cover the additional costs and decrease the TW PAF by a like cost.  The total project economics remain unchanged. 



(Rod based on this solution, I don't think it needs to be discussed at Stan's meeting Monday). 



Jerry, I will get with you next week on the Peak Day 2000 discussion
This follows up on my voice-mail to you of just a few minutes ago.  I reviewed a voice-mail from Theresa Bushman this morning about the timing on the new Mariner matter that Mariner for which Mariner would like to retain F&J.  She has spoken with Scott Josie, apparently one of our business people, and has been advised that the December 27 closing is critical, due to market conditions.  Theresa also believes that the December 27 date will be aggressive even for F&J, given the late date.  Theresa, please let me know if I have mischaracterized what you said.



    I see two options:



    1.  If you agree with me that we can't sign the letter as is:  I do my best to get an acceptable letter negotiated with Uriel Dutton today.  If I can't, Mariner retains someone else today.   Frankly, I am not optimistic about getting an acceptable letter from F&J, based on where F&J started.



    2.  If you believe that we need to go ahead and get the best deal we can from F&J under the circumstances: I will do my best to get that done by noon or so, and if F&J doesn't budge, we may have to sign the letter as is.



    Caveat:  I don't know if Dutton is in the office this week, so he and I may not be able to communicate quickly.  Also, if we redraft a letter, we will probably not have time to get comments back from all the other interested Enron attorneys.  



    I would also suggest telling Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC, this morning what our game plan is, and if it is option one, have her go ahead and contact her back-up choices of law firms, start running conflicts checks, etc., and have them be ready to hit the ground running.



    If there is anyone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know.



    I am in all day today; please let me know what you want me to do.



    Britt

John O'Shea was looking for the revenue backup for NNG.
We will defer to Rates & Certificates on this one.    We need to be thinking about what each entity is getting for it's investment in the project. 



And there should be no tax grossup since the taxable entity will not be paying tax on the transaction.     And I think the tariff reads that it can only be charged if in fact it will be paid.

FirstEnergy and GPU Close Merger















By Will McNamara



Director, Electric Industry Analysis











[News item from PR Newswire] FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) closed its merger=



 with GPU Inc. on Nov. 6 and announced that members of its Board of Directo=



rs had been named. The effective date of the merger is Nov. 7, 2001. With =



today's closing of our merger, we will begin operating as a larger, stronge=



r company, better positioned to provide significant benefits to our custome=



rs, shareholders and employees, said FirstEnergy Chief Executive Officer H=



. Peter Burg.







Analysis: When compared to 2000 and 1999, 2001 has turned out to be a rathe=



r anti-climatic year with regard to merger and acquisition activity in the =



energy industry. In fact, when compared to the early days of deregulation, =



M&A activity has slowed from a flood to a slow drip. The days of combining =



two vertically integrated utility companies to gain scale and guarantee sur=



vival appear to be on the decline. Partnerships will still continue, of cou=



rse, but they are now of a different breed than before and have become far =



more focused on a particular market niche. One exception to the rather unev=



entful M&A scoreboard this year is the just-completed $4.2-billion partners=



hip between FirstEnergy and GPU, which reportedly will create an electric u=



tility serving 4.2 million customers from Toledo, Ohio to the New Jersey sh=



ore. The two companies have positioned their partnership as creating the p=



remier supplier in a 13-state region. However, while one of the few intere=



sting deals this year, the FirstEnergy / GPU partnership has not been witho=



ut controversy, especially with regard to lingering financial obligations t=



hat GPU has in the Three Mile Island nuclear plant.=20







First, let's establish the basics about this partnership. Akron, Ohio-based=



 FirstEnergy has purchased Morristown, N.J.-based GPU Inc., paying a divide=



nd of $0.42392 a share that will be payable on Nov. 28. FirstEnergy-itself =



a product of a 1997 merger between Ohio Edison and Centerior Inc. -is alrea=



dy an energy services holding company serving 2.2 million customers within =



13,200 square miles of northern and central Ohio and western Pennsylvania. =



FirstEnergy also provides natural-gas service to approximately 50,000 custo=



mers in the Midwest and is involved in the exploration and production of oi=



l and natural gas, and the transmission and marketing of natural gas, with =



resources that include proven reserves of 450 billion cubic feet equivalent=



 of natural gas and oil-about 90 percent natural gas-and approximately 5,00=



0 miles of pipelines. FirstEnergy also owns 7,500 miles of transmission lin=



es, with 35 interconnections in 6 electric systems, and is a member of the =



Alliance RTO. FirstEnergy has a market capitalization of $8.1 billion, a P/=



E ratio of 12.99, and its shares currently are priced at $35.72.=20







GPU Inc. is an international provider of energy-related infrastructure and =



services. Domestically, its three electric utility subsidiaries-doing busin=



ess as GPU Energy-serve two million customers in Pennsylvania and New Jerse=



y. Through the GPU International Group, GPU develops, owns and operates tra=



nsmission and distribution facilities overseas. GPU has a market capitaliza=



tion of $4.8 billion, a P/E ratio of 10.51, and on its last day of trading =



(Nov. 6) its shares were priced at $40.39.







From its inception, the primary objective of this acquisition was to enable=



 FirstEnergy to become the premier regional energy and related services pro=



vider in the northeastern quadrant of the United States. A key part of this=



 strategy is the expansion of the combined company's unregulated marketing =



opportunities, including the acceleration of a retail business that FirstEn=



ergy gains by buying GPU.







After Nov. 7, FirstEnergy will begin operating as a registered holding comp=



any with seven electric utility operating companies-Ohio Edison, The Illumi=



nating Company, Toledo Edison, Metropolitan Edison, Pennsylvania Electric, =



Pennsylvania Power, and Jersey Power & Light-which reportedly will comprise=



 the fourth-largest investor-owned electric system in the United States, ba=



sed on amount of customers. As noted the combined company has billed itself=



 as the premier supplier in a 13-state region. Those 13 states are New York=



, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Oh=



io, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. However, it is cl=



ear that, among these 13 states, the combined company has already establish=



ed a particularly strong business in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio, whe=



re it will maintain a geographic presence of 23 percent, 28 percent and 49 =



percent, respectively.=20







According to a presentation made by CEO Peter Burg earlier this year, the a=



cquisition of GPU Inc. will optimize FirstEnergy's generation portfolio, =



by, among other things, increasing its customer load and the utilization of=



 its baseload units. Prior to the acquisition, FirstEnergy operated 16 powe=



r plants with a total system capacity of nearly 13,000 MW. Out of this tota=



l generating capacity, 58 percent (7,471 MW) is produced using coal; 29 per=



cent (3,779 MW) comes from nuclear plants; 10 percent (1,273 MW) is fueled =



by natural gas or oil; and 3 percent (435 MW) comes from pumped-storage hyd=



roelectric facilities. Through the acquisition of GPU, FirstEnergy reported=



ly will gain 1,155 MW in peaking generation and the opportunity for over 80=



0 MW of capacity releases. Company information indicates that FirstEnergy p=



roduced nearly 70 million MWh of electricity over the last year.=20







As noted, while the partnership between FirstEnergy and GPU is for the most=



 part quite synergistic and has obtained its necessary regulatory approvals=



 in a comparatively smooth fashion, the deal has not been completely withou=



t controversy. For instance, a Pittsburgh-based consumer group known as Cit=



izen Power has expressed concern that the partnership will ultimately prove=



 harmful for consumers of the combined company. Specifically, the group cla=



ims that FirstEnergy customers have already been paying $9 billion in stran=



ded costs and could be forced to pay for additional charges associated with=



 GPU's partial ownership of the Three Mile Island Nuclear plant. Despite th=



e fact that the merger is now officially completed, Citizen Power reportedl=



y has asked a Pennsylvania court to require state energy regulators in that=



 state to reverse the approval of the merger. One of the group's arguments =



is that the Pennsylvania PUC did not require either FirstEnergy or GPU to d=



emonstrate how the merger would benefit or otherwise impact the public and =



did not seek approval from the groups involved in GPU's restructuring agree=



ment with the state. Other groups in Ohio have similar frustrations with th=



e PUC in that state and are concerned about any increases in FirstEnergy ra=



tes that may occur as a result of payments that GPU is still making toward =



Three Mile Island.=20







There is some public confusion surrounding GPU's holdings in Three Mile Isl=



and, which can be easily clarified. There are two nuclear units at the Thre=



e Mile Island (TMI) nuclear plant, Units 1 and 2. In late 1999, GPU sold TM=



I-1 to AmerGen Energy, the joint venture between PECO Energy and British En=



ergy Co., for $100 million, which was about one-sixth of the book value for=



 the unit. The ownership of the plant known as TMI-2 has remained with GPU.=



 In 1979, TMI-2 was the site of the nation's worst nuclear accident, in whi=



ch nearly half the uranium core melted. The TMI-2 unit is essentially dead =



and has not functioned since 1979. However, GPU has continued to keep the p=



lant in a state of monitored storage, and has encountered some expenses r=



elated to staff, etc., which continue to monitor the unit. The concern from=



 some consumers, whether it is valid or not, is that FirstEnergy, which now=



 owns TMI-2 due to its acquisition of GPU, will be picking up any residual =



expenses related to this unit. Specifically, TMI-2 is not scheduled to be d=



ecommissioned until 2014 at the earliest, and there may be some cleanup cos=



ts associated with the decommissioning that may exceed current estimates.







It is important to note that GPU has very little of its own generation asse=



ts. The company has followed a revised strategy over the last year that inc=



luded the exit of the merchant energy business and a clear focus on the tra=



nsmission and distribution sectors of the industry, as well as new non-regu=



lated businesses. Another pending acquisition of some remaining GPU assets =



involves UtiliCorp's $2.1 billion offer for Avon Energy Partners Holdings s=



ubsidiary, the holding company for Midlands Electricity, which reportedly i=



s the fourth-largest regional electricity company in the United Kingdom. Th=



is deal should move forward, although it was contingent on the completion o=



f FirstEnergy's acquisition of GPU. FirstEnergy had previously established =



that it had no interest in retaining GPU's international assets, which incl=



ude small holdings in Great Britain, Australia and South America. In additi=



on, the offer makes sense for FirstEnergy, because it provides the company =



with available capital to pay down acquisition debt and possibly fund addit=



ional acquisitions.=20







Moreover, FirstEnergy executives believe any possible negatives in its acqu=



isition of GPU are outweighed by the positives. Again, the fundamental bene=



fit of the FirstEnergy / GPU partnership is that it should create one of th=



e leading-if not the leading-electric providers in a stretch of territory f=



rom Ohio to New Jersey. FirstEnergy gains significantly in the deal by acqu=



iring GPU's customer base and the ability to optimize its own existing and =



growing generation arsenal. Plus, FirstEnergy also gains GPU's remaining ge=



neration capacity, which is rather minimal but does include about 1,155 MW =



in peaking generation. From a broad perspective, FirstEnergy and GPU have f=



ollowed through with a rather smooth merger process, which certainly repres=



ents an atypical development against a landscape of terminated consolidated=



 deals this year.=20







UPDATE ON SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPALIZATION VOTE: See the 11/6/01 IssueAlert  =



<http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/article.asp?id=3D979>for a full des=



cription of Measures F and I that appeared on the ballot in San Francisco a=



nd Brisbane, Calif., in yesterday's election. Both measures related to muni=



cipalizing the electric system currently owned by Pacific Gas & Electric Co=



. According to data obtained from the San Francisco Department of Elections=



 as of early morning on Nov. 7, voter turnout in the area was 25.16 percent=



. Measure F, which would create a Municipal Water & Power Agency in San Fra=



ncisco only, passed by a very slim margin of 56,008 votes (51.02 percent) t=



o 53,760 votes (48.98). The passage of this measure will create a new agenc=



y in the city of San Francisco (not a municipal utility district) that will=



 not include the city of Brisbane. The agency will be governed by an electe=



d seven-member board of directors and reportedly will replace the current j=



urisdictional oversight by the California Public Utilities Commission.=20







Measure I, which would have created a Municipal Utility District (MUD) in b=



oth San Francisco and Brisbane, did not pass. However, it was defeated by a=



 very slim margin of 53,865 votes (50.63 percent) to 52,524 votes (49.37 pe=



rcent).=20







It is not presently clear whether or not all of the absentee votes have bee=



n calculated in this election, and thus there is a good chance that the abo=



ve tally may change in the next few days and could possibly alter the outco=



me of this election.=20







While Pacific Gas & Electric Co. put a positive spin on the election result=



s in a press release that is circulating today, the fact of the matter is t=



hat this was a very close election. While the city of Brisbane shot down th=



e idea of a MUD, San Francisco is proceeding with a Municipal Water & Power=



 Agency, which at some point may also attempt to seize the transmission and=



 distribution assets of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Without question, the pu=



blic power debate in this area is far from over and in many ways has receiv=



ed a boost from this election. I will continue to follow the story and prov=



ide further updates that occur from regional analysis.=20

Subject:  West U Soccer's New Skill Development Program







Dear Coaches,



In an effort to continue the development  of the West U Soccer program to

become one of the finest in the city, we have  introduced some innovative

ways to provide the players with greater development  while having fun.



This year we have already introduced once  a week training for all players

who participate in the West U Soccer in house  programs.  From the reaction

I have  received to date this has been very successful.  We plan to

continue to make improvement  in this program to make it the finest in the

city.



In pursuit of this goal, West U Soccer is  sponsoring in conjunction with

Nebo Pro Soccer Academy a skill development  program for our players from

U-6 through U-19.



The goals of this program:



?      To provide players in  their development years the ability to

develop the skills necessary to enjoy the  game.



?      Have fun while  learning



?      Play fun games and  play against other competition.



?      Coach mentoring by  association with pro trainers



Last week was a trial run of the clinic  and I have a child who is a U-6

player.   He had a great time and learned a lot about soccer and wants to

go next  week because he had so much fun.



Nebo has done a great job of developing a  curriculum for all types of

player from the serious to the recreational.  He has assembled a staff of

trainers who  are well recognized.



If you have players who may be interested  in the training, I strongly

recommend that you hand out the attached sign-up  sheet at your next

practice.



Please tell the player who are interested  to bring the form on Sunday

September 23 at 5:00 to West U Elementary Field for  sign-up.



Thank you for your consideration on this matter .

(See attached file: Nebo OPEN SKILLS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.pdf)

Why do our numbers look so high in the 4th quarter and then fall off so much?     We have to get a better handle on all of this and fast.
Steve, Rob asked me to send the following suggested Q & A to you:



Q:  From a business standpoint are Gipper and Rockne now one company?



A:  Not until closing, which may not occur for several months.  Until that time the law [antitrust law] requires that we continue to deal with one another on a commercial level as competitors, just as we have in the past.  In general, this means that we cannot share commercial information, coordinate commercial behavior, agree on prices, etc.  We should act towards Rockne the same way that we would act toward any other competitor.



I trust this is what you needed.  If not just let me know.  Thanks.
Please view the attached NNG Reserve Schedule for August 2001.

Messers Walters, Zahn, and McEllin are going to go back thru yr end audit workpaper files and pull those that (hopefully) support

balances or year to year variations for each line item of the audited income statement and balance sheet, and selected cash flow items. They will start w 2000vs1999 and work back from there. We intend to have an initial package within a week.
Steve Kean has scheduled a meeting at 11:30pm in EB 3321 to discuss the communication package.  



Derrick and Haedicke:  Please invite others in your group that should attend.
Here are the answers to questions 1, 2, & 4:



1.  What percent of TW's volumes transported during the 3rd Qtr 2000 and 3rd Qtr 2001 was firm

     vs. interruptible?





                                2000                        2001

                July    Aug Sept        July    Aug Sept

IT Percentage           .09 .09 .09     .10 .08 .07

Firm Percentage     .91 .91 .91     .90 .92 .93





2.  What percent of TW's pipe capacity was used during  3rd Qtr 2000 and 3rd Qtr 2001? 

 

                    2000                        2001

West flow information       July    Aug Sept        July    Aug Sept

Percentage flow vs. capacity    .90 .95 .97          100     100     .91





                    2000                        2001

East flow information       July    Aug Sept        July    Aug Sept

Percentage flow vs. capacity    .81 .85 .86      100     100     .91



4.    On James Weitekamp's ETS Selected Financial and Operating Highlights schedule, transport 

      volumes are shown as being higher for 3rd Qtr 2001 as compared to 1st Qtr 2001.  This doesn't 

      really make sense considering 1st Qtr is a peak time and 3rd Qtr is not.  Why does this difference

      exist?

 

     July and August are peak times for TW.  However, during the 3rd quarter volumes flowing 

     East to West decreased due to pricing.  Volumes significantly increased from East to East because 

     pricing was better, increasing total throughput for the 3rd quarter.
How does this look?



 



Also, I did change some numbers in the excel spreadsheet:



    The Ignacio to Blanco subscription levels were pulling from the row excluding ROFR capacity in the supporting sheet.  I changed it to be consistent with the other  capacities (which include ROFR capacity).



    Shelley had made some assumptions about East of Thoreau capacity subscription, such as, the USGT 400,000/d contract would remain subscribed (it doesn't     have ROFR) and she had included the extension of 2-3 other contracts that don't have ROFR.  These contracts were then dropped after 2005.  I continued the  extensions through 2006.



    I changed the East of Thoreau capacity to 750,000/d from 850,000/d.
Per Rod's note below, how are you guys coming on the Lay budget attendee list for Stan to review for final approval?



Cindy
Per the conversation in Steve's staff meeting yesterday, I double checked with Property Accounting

and they verified that the funds in the amount of $291,861 were released on 11/6.



If there is anything else you need, please let me know.



Thanks!

Does anyone know the following applications for Subscriber membership?  I

Thanks Mary



1.  Commercial Risk Reinsurance Co. - a wholly owned subsidiary of SCOR, is

a specialist insurer and reinsurer that underwrites a diversified portfolio

of business on a worldwide basis.  Based in Bermuda.



2.  ACA Risk Structures, L.L.C. - see following description provided by the

applicant:



A. Background.



ACA Risk Structures, L.L.C. is a limited liability company organized on May

4, 2001 under the laws of the State of Delaware.  ACA Risk Structures is the

swaps vehicle for the ACA group of companies and, as such, its primary

business purpose is to enter into derivative transactions.  The Applicant

does not intend to make markets in derivatives.



B. Ownership and Related Entities.



The sole owner and member of ACA Risk Structures is ACA Risk Solutions,

L.L.C. (ACA Risk Solutions).  ACA Risk Solutions is a Delaware limited

liability company created as a vehicle for ownership of ACA Risk Structures

and other subsidiaries.  The sole member of ACA Risk Solutions is American

Capital Access Holdings, Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (Holdings).

Holdings also owns the Applicant's affiliate ACA Financial Guaranty

Corporation (ACA Financial Guaranty), an A rated financial guaranty

insurance company that commenced operations in late 1997.  ACA Financial

Guaranty is a Maryland-domiciled monoline insurance company with its

principal office in New York, New York.  ACA Financial Guaranty is licensed

to provide financial guaranty insurance in all 50 states, the District of

Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.  ACA Financial

Guaranty's primary business is the provision of financial guaranty insurance

on financial obligations that are rated from A- to BB or that are

unrated and have in ACA Financial Guaranty's opinion an equivalent credit

quality.
Attached is the revised capital charge file.  There was a formula problem in the previous version.  Sorry for the confusion.
The 2 of you should probably listen in on this stuff to make sure you don't have some of the info needed
Please find attached file. No major individual ($5.0 MM or greater) receipts or disbursements  anticipated over the last four days this month.
I won't guarantee I can make it, but I will try.     Here are some thoughts, as we move forward with this deal:



Levelized rates - will require separate rate base, not rolled in, since the base system is not levelized and separate tariff schedules like a FTS-2

    Also we need to see what the GAAP income statments will look like and what the return on equity will really look like if we do this.    It may surprise some of the     people.    I also think we need to make sure Stan is OK with the potential result if we are going to offer it.
Tracy:



I did a preliminary Weekly for Steve since he will be on vacation the rest of this week.  I will do another one tomorrow.

Just wanted to give him a look at where we are since we did not do a Weekly last week.

Please review and if it is OK I will give it to Steve.



Thanks!

Attached is the capital charge file which has been corrected for a formula error in August.  I appreciate everyone's efforts in auditing this.
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



The information provides further details about:



    -- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;

    -- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;

    -- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 

    -- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and

    -- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.



This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  



Restatement of Earnings



Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:



Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:



    -- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997

    -- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998

    -- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 

    -- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000

    -- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 

    -- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001

    -- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  



The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.



The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.



You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.



We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.
YOu need to attend this one.   Kevin:   you may also want to attend.
Commercial Risk Reinsurance is very well known and reputable, according to

the BoA insurance portfolio manager.

We do see ACA a lot through our muni derivatives business.  They will insure

lower rated credits (A- to BBB-, and some below that) who are seeking an A

rating but do not want to pay for a AAA rating.  Should be fine from our

standpoint.
A few people have requested the agenda for the offsite tomorrow and Friday.  We had originally intended to distribute it at the meeting tomorrow, but here it is!



PLEASE NOTE THAT WE START AT 8:30 BOTH DAYS.



Please let me know if you have any questions.



If you need directions to the San Luis Hotel in Galveston, please call Sharron Westbrook or me.



Thanks!
How soon can you add things like payroll to the picture?.
Tracy, our current forecast includes a gross bonus accrual of $13m for the

full year (Note that a portion of this amount is capitalize through our labor

loading process - about 33%).  This is significantly below our target level

for the year ($16.5m) and last year's actual payout of $16.7m.  We reduced

these amounts based on our lower that expected performance in Q3 that we've

been discussing.  Early this year we we're accruing at a maximum amount of

$17.6 since our forecasts looked better at the time.

Here' s the layout of how this falls by quarter in the forecast:

Q1 - $4.4

Q2 - $4.4

Q3 - $1.0 (forecast)

Q4 - $3.2 (forecast)

       $13.0



Based on how Q4 results look, we will reassess our accrual levels at that

time.   Let me know if you have any questions. 



>>> Geaccone, Tracy 09/19/01 10:46AM >>> 

I only need bonus data. Don't worry about 4Q data today. Please send directly

to me. 



Thanks
John O'Shea was still looking for the revenue back up to the 2002 plan numbers.  Do either one of you have this?
Tracy, FYI, I already provided a list of Q4 challenges/hurdles to Rod a couple

of days ago.  Let me know if you need a copy.



>>> Geaccone, Tracy 09/19/01 10:46AM >>> 

I only need bonus data. Don't worry about 4Q data today. Please send directly

to me. 



Thanks

FOR LANCE SCHULER
How did it go at the doctor? What did they say?

Love You.
larry further to our discussion this morning attached the powers of attorney that I discussed we would like to get them executed so that we would in a position to sign the sale sale agreement today. I am currently working on the resolutions.





David Minns
I have a very important video announcement about the future of our company.  Please go to <http://home.enron.com/message/> to access the video.  Thank you.
Have F&J send the file back.  I'll send it to V&E.
FYI - If this request is approved, the reclassification/reporting of AFUDC Equity within Other Income-Other should result in an additional $700K to IBIT for 2001 (NNG $500K, TW $200K).
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.



Deal Terms



--  The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.

--  ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.

--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.

--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.



Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.



Management of Newly Formed Company



Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.



I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.



Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.



The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.



As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.



I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.



I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.



And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

California Develops Plan=20



to Renegotiate Long-Term=20



Power Contracts as State=20



Faces Energy Surplus=20















By Will McNamara



Director, Electric Industry Analysis























[News item from the Los Angeles Times] After months of defending the $43 bi=



llion worth of long-term electricity contracts he helped negotiate on behal=



f of the state, S. David Freeman suggested for the first time this week tha=



t the contracts be renegotiated, perhaps through the California Power and C=



onservation Financing Authority, a new public power agency he now chairs. =



There seems to be pretty general agreement that these contracts need to be =



renegotiated, said Freeman, noting that critics of the contracts include G=



ov. Gray Davis, the president of the California Public Utilities Commission=



 and the leader of the State Senate. Freeman said he is still proud of his =



work negotiating the contracts with companies Davis labeled at the time as =



gougers and pirates, but California's energy picture has vastly changed sin=



ce January.=20







Analysis: Oh, yeah, the California energy crisis ? remember that? For some,=



 it may seem like ancient history that California suffered through an ill-f=



ated experiment with electric deregulation that led to some devastating con=



sequences, especially considering the Enron saga that now occupies headline=



s in the energy industry. Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that, ev=



en though rolling blackouts in the state are no longer an imminent threat, =



some fundamental problems that defined the California energy crisis continu=



e to plague the state. As one of the main resolution steps that were taken =



to repair the dysfunctional market, the state of California stepped into a =



very involved role as power purchaser on behalf of the state's three IOUs (=



Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & =



Electric Co.), which due to credit problems were unable to secure power on =



their own. In an ironic twist indicating that California's problems are far=



 from over, the stabilization of the state's markets are now in essence cau=



sing a new set of challenges and casting light on what appear to be questio=



nable choices made by the state at the height of the crisis.=20







At issue presently are some 54 long-term contracts that the state of Califo=



rnia, through its Department of Water Resources, signed with power generato=



rs such as Calpine (NYSE: CPN), Duke (NYSE: DUK), Mirant (NYSE: MIR), and W=



illiams (NYSE: WMB) to name a few back in early 2001, a time at which whole=



sale power prices were still running at very high levels. One of the primar=



y benefits of the contracts was that they reduced the state's reliance on t=



he volatile spot market, where prices had soared as high as $500/MWh. As a =



whole the contracts are worth about $43 billion and have a lifespan of 10 y=



ears or more. Some might argue that Gov. Davis, who led the effort for the =



state to assume the role of power purchaser, felt pressure to sign the cont=



racts at that time, due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial solven=



cy of Pacific Gas & Electric and SCE in particular. However, critics argue =



that the contracts locked the state into wholesale power costs when prices =



were the highest.=20







Much of the details of the contracts signed by the state are proprietary, b=



ut there are some interesting details that can be gleaned. First, a good nu=



mber of the contracts lock the state in to buying power at various times, i=



ncluding those of low demand (such as the morning). This leaves the state w=



ith a surplus of power that it does not need, which it in turn has been for=



ced to sell at a loss. We also know that, as a general observation, the sta=



te bought power under the long-term contracts at an average price of $75/MW=



h. That same power reportedly will sell for only $16/MWh in 2002.=20







As noted, Freeman, who previously managed the municipal utility known as th=



e Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, recently assumed the managemen=



t post of the new California Power and Conservation Financing Authority at =



the request of Gov. Davis. The agency was charged with quelling the extreme=



 situation that California faced over the last year, including soaring powe=



r prices and blackouts. Looking beyond the immediate problems that have sub=



sided, Freeman's new plan calls for a way to renegotiate the existing contr=



acts and increase generation supply in the state at the same time.=20







Let me try to put Freeman's plan into a nutshell. As a state agency, the Po=



wer Authority could sell up to $4 billion in revenue bonds, which would be =



guaranteed by energy sales, to lease, build or buy power plants. Consequent=



ly, the state, which can borrow money at below-market rates, is in a positi=



on to build new plants more cheaply than private companies could. As a carr=



ot to entice the renegotiation of the long-term contracts, the state could =



offer generating companies a financial incentive to build new power plants =



in the state. In other words, the state would carry the investment for the =



costs of the new plants, alleviating pressure on the private companies to p=



rovide a 20-percent return to their shareholders. Note that most of the gen=



erating companies involved in long-term contracts with California are commi=



tted to building new power plants anyway. Some reports I've seen indicate t=



hat 70 percent of the 54 contracts that the state has signed include clause=



s that require the generating companies to build new power plants in the st=



ate. However, under normal circumstances, the expense of building the new p=



lants would be financed by the generating companies and could cost hundreds=



 of millions of dollars. Thus, in return for the financial incentive, the s=



ame generating companies would agree to renegotiate the terms of their long=



-term contracts with the state of California, presumably based on current m=



arket conditions. Note that the renegotiation could include cutting the pri=



ces in the contracts, or providing the state with more flexibility on the t=



iming and quantity of electricity that must be purchased.=20







The word from California is that most state officials think this plan has s=



ome legs. Nevertheless, word of the plan comes on the heels of claims that =



California is presently suffering from an energy glut (unused electricity) =



that may end up costing ratepayers as much as $3.9 billion over the next de=



cade. The reason for the surplus power is that Californians have increased =



conservation efforts, which brought demand down, a condition that was maint=



ained by comparatively moderate weather trends. The end result is that the =



state apparently bought far more power than it needed to meet the needs of =



the customers served by the three IOUs, and the state unfortunately cannot =



sell the excess power elsewhere and gain a profit. For instance, according =



to a report by the Department of Water Resources, in one three-month, low-u=



sage period expected in the spring of 2002, 57 percent of the power for whi=



ch the state has contracted will have to be sold at a loss of close to 80 c=



ents on the dollar, ultimately costing utility customers as much as $193 mi=



llion. The same report indicates that the power surplus in the state will r=



each its peak in 2004 and then gradually decline through 2010.=20







Consequently, despite the financial advantages of Freeman's plan, the logis=



tics of getting new power plants approved in the state in light of the appa=



rent energy glut may be an impediment to the renegotiation strategy. In add=



ition, some of the companies involved in the contracts with the state alrea=



dy own a large amount of generation capacity in California and may not be e=



asily convinced to build new plants right away. For instance, Calpine Corp.=



, which is one of the companies that has signed a long-term deal with the s=



tate of California, responded to the plan as saying that it wouldn't be an=



ything that Calpine would use. The company reportedly has finished three n=



ew power plants since June 2001 and would not be enticed by the financing i=



ncentive that the state is orchestrating. Further, the state's desire to re=



negotiate terms of the contracts is not a new concept. Ever since wholesale=



 prices began to drop earlier this year, the renegotiation debate has been =



a fixture of state legislative and regulatory proceedings. However, since t=



he onset of the talks, a good number of the generating companies have maint=



ained that re-negotiation would not be possible as they had already locked =



themselves into deals with natural-gas suppliers.=20







Thus, one concern is that the apparent energy glut in California will disco=



urage further development of new generation and renewable energy sources, a=



t least in the near term, which could set the state up for another dangerou=



s boom-and-bust cycle down the road. In addition, those companies that alre=



ady have long-term contracts with the state (such as Calpine) may not be en=



ticed by the financing incentive, and those companies that don't have long-=



term contracts with the state will have no incentive at all to build new pl=



ants in California. All of this could create a situation in which Californi=



a has too much power over the next few years and then will find itself in a=



nother shortage situation 10 or more years down the line.=20







Freeman is apparently also pushing the state to once again make an attempt =



to take over some of Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s physical assets. Instead =



of its transmission lines, however, the state now is examining its opportun=



ity to buy the hydroelectric generation network (including dams and powerho=



uses) owned by the state's largest electric utility. Note that under its re=



structuring plan that has been submitted for regulatory approval, Pacific G=



as & Electric Co. would split from its parent, PG&E Corp., and transfer gen=



erating and electric and gas transmission assets to form three new companie=



s, which would fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory=



 Commission (FERC). State regulators do not like this plan, and thus are se=



eking a way to retain control over the generating and transmission assets o=



f Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Putting the hydroelectric assets under the Sta=



te Power Authority would keep the assets under state control.=20







Moreover, even though California is rethinking certain choices it made almo=



st a year ago that directly entrenched the state government in the energy m=



arket, state officials still seem to want to gain control over fundamental =



parts of the state's energy infrastructure. Remember that Gov. Davis spent =



much of the last year attempting unsuccessfully to negotiate deals with SCE=



 and SDG&E for the purchase of the utilities' transmission networks. Pacifi=



c Gas & Electric Co. never was interested in selling its transmission asset=



s, which it believed the state's offer grossly undervalued. One of the main=



 reasons that these attempts by the governor were unsuccessful was concern =



by state legislators who argued that the state was ill equipped to assume o=



peration of the complex transmission networks. Nevertheless, in addition to=



 renegotiating the long-term contracts, the state is still pursuing at leas=



t the hydroelectric generation assets of Pacific Gas & Electric.=20

California Develops Plan=20



to Renegotiate Long-Term=20



Power Contracts as State=20



Faces Energy Surplus=20















By Will McNamara



Director, Electric Industry Analysis























[News item from the Los Angeles Times] After months of defending the $43 bi=



llion worth of long-term electricity contracts he helped negotiate on behal=



f of the state, S. David Freeman suggested for the first time this week tha=



t the contracts be renegotiated, perhaps through the California Power and C=



onservation Financing Authority, a new public power agency he now chairs. =



There seems to be pretty general agreement that these contracts need to be =



renegotiated, said Freeman, noting that critics of the contracts include G=



ov. Gray Davis, the president of the California Public Utilities Commission=



 and the leader of the State Senate. Freeman said he is still proud of his =



work negotiating the contracts with companies Davis labeled at the time as =



gougers and pirates, but California's energy picture has vastly changed sin=



ce January.=20







Analysis: Oh, yeah, the California energy crisis ... remember that? For som=



e, it may seem like ancient history that California suffered through an ill=



-fated experiment with electric deregulation that led to some devastating c=



onsequences, especially considering the Enron saga that now occupies headli=



nes in the energy industry. Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that, =



even though rolling blackouts in the state are no longer an imminent threat=



, some fundamental problems that defined the California energy crisis conti=



nue to plague the state. As one of the main resolution steps that were take=



n to repair the dysfunctional market, the state of California stepped into =



a very involved role as power purchaser on behalf of the state's three IOUs=



 (Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas =



& Electric Co.), which due to credit problems were unable to secure power o=



n their own. In an ironic twist indicating that California's problems are f=



ar from over, the stabilization of the state's markets are now in essence c=



ausing a new set of challenges and casting light on what appear to be quest=



ionable choices made by the state at the height of the crisis.=20







At issue presently are some 54 long-term contracts that the state of Califo=



rnia, through its Department of Water Resources, signed with power generato=



rs such as Calpine (NYSE: CPN), Duke (NYSE: DUK), Mirant (NYSE: MIR), and W=



illiams (NYSE: WMB) back in early 2001, at a time at which wholesale power =



prices were still running at very high levels. One of the primary benefits =



of the contracts was that it reduced the state's reliance on the volatile s=



pot market, where prices had soared as high as $500/MWh. As a whole the con=



tracts are worth about $43 billion and have a lifespan of 10 years or more.=



 Some might argue that Gov. Davis, who led the effort for the state to assu=



me the role of power purchaser, felt pressure to sign the contracts at that=



 time, due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial solvency of Pacific=



 Gas & Electric and SCE in particular. However, critics argue that the cont=



racts locked the state into wholesale power costs when prices were the high=



est.=20







Much of the details of the contracts signed by the state are proprietary, b=



ut there are some interesting details that can be gleaned. First, a good nu=



mber of the contracts lock the state in to buying power at various times, i=



ncluding those of low demand (such as the morning). This leaves the state w=



ith a surplus of power that it does not need, which it in turn has been for=



ced to sell at a loss. We also know that, as a general observation, the sta=



te bought power under the long-term contracts at an average price of $75/MW=



h. That same power reportedly will sell for only $16/MWh in 2002.=20







As noted, Freeman, who previously managed the municipal utility known as th=



e Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, recently assumed the managemen=



t post of the new California Power and Conservation Financing Authority at =



the request of Gov. Davis. The agency was charged with quelling the extreme=



 situation that California faced over the last year, including soaring powe=



r prices and blackouts. Looking beyond the immediate problems that have sub=



sided, Freeman's new plan calls for a way to renegotiate the existing contr=



acts and increase generation supply in the state at the same time.=20







Let me try to put Freeman's plan into a nutshell. As a state agency, the Po=



wer Authority could sell up to $4 billion in revenue bonds, which would be =



guaranteed by energy sales, to lease, build or buy power plants. Consequent=



ly, the state, which can borrow money at below-market rates, is in a positi=



on to build new plants more cheaply than private companies could. As a carr=



ot to entice the renegotiation of the long-term contracts, the state could =



offer generating companies a financial incentive to build new power plants =



in the state. In other words, the state would carry the investment for the =



costs of the new plants, alleviating pressure on the private companies to p=



rovide a 20-percent return to their shareholders. Note that most of the gen=



erating companies involved in long-term contracts with California are commi=



tted to building new power plants anyway. Some reports I've seen indicate t=



hat 70 percent of the 54 contracts that the state has signed include clause=



s that require the generating companies to build new power plants in the st=



ate. However, under normal circumstances, the expense of building the new p=



lants would be financed by the generating companies and could cost hundreds=



 of millions of dollars. Thus, in return for the financial incentive, the s=



ame generating companies would agree to renegotiate the terms of their long=



-term contracts with the state of California, presumably based on current m=



arket conditions. Note that the renegotiation could include cutting the pri=



ces in the contracts, or providing the state with more flexibility on the t=



iming and quantity of electricity that must be purchased.=20







The word from California is that most state officials think this plan has s=



ome legs. Nevertheless, word of the plan comes on the heels of claims that =



California is presently suffering from an energy glut (unused electricity) =



that may end up costing ratepayers as much as $3.9 billion over the next de=



cade. The reason for the surplus power is that Californians have increased =



conservation efforts, which brought demand down, a condition that was maint=



ained by comparatively moderate weather trends. The end result is that the =



state apparently bought far more power than it needed to meet the needs of =



the customers served by the three IOUs, and the state unfortunately cannot =



sell the excess power elsewhere and gain a profit. For instance, according =



to a report by the Department of Water Resources, in one three-month, low-u=



sage period expected in the spring of 2002, 57 percent of the power for whi=



ch the state has contracted will have to be sold at a loss of close to 80 c=



ents on the dollar, ultimately costing utility customers as much as $193 mi=



llion. The same report indicates that the power surplus in the state will r=



each its peak in 2004 and then gradually decline through 2010.=20







Consequently, despite the financial advantages of Freeman's plan, the logis=



tics of getting new power plants approved in the state in light of the appa=



rent energy glut may be an impediment to the renegotiation strategy. In add=



ition, some of the companies involved in the contracts with the state alrea=



dy own a large amount of generation capacity in the state and may not be ea=



sily convinced to build new plants right away. For instance, Calpine Corp.,=



 which is one of the companies that has signed a long-term deal with the st=



ate of California, responded to the plan as saying that it wouldn't be any=



thing that Calpine would use. The company reportedly has finished three ne=



w power plants since June 2001 and would not be enticed by the financing in=



centive that the state is orchestrating. Further, the state's desire to ren=



egotiate terms of the contracts is not a new concept. Ever since wholesale =



prices began to drop earlier this year, the renegotiation debate has been a=

hemselves into deals with natural-gas suppliers.=20







Thus, one concern is that the apparent energy glut in California will disco=



urage further development of new generation and renewable energy sources, a=



t least in the near term, which could set the state up for another dangerou=



s boom-and-bust cycle down the road. In addition, those companies that alre=

ants in the state. All of this could create a situation in which California=



 has too much power over the next few years and then will find itself in an=

to take over some of Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s physical assets. Instead =

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:



?   Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  



?   After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.



?   The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  



To move funds:

On the Web, choose Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation from the drop down menu.

On Voice Response, choose request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.

This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.



To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.
The payment is a non-discretionary obligation for NNG.  I am only suggesting we change the timing of the payment.  In terms of the 2001 3rd Current Estimate, there would be an upside.



I'm not sure why we can't afford it since we have been talking about a much larger base gas purchase transaction.  Has the cash/earnings outlook changed?  



.
Jordan, in response to your questions concerning the issuance of letters of credit starting today, I think that the response needs to address two situations: the committed lc facilities [Chase and West LB] and the uncommitted facilities.



Since the uncommitted facilities involve minimal representations, they are not typically an issue [although we still need to review each circumstance individually], and unless there is a specific representation to Enron Corp.'s audited financials for the period 97-00 being prepared in accordance with GAAP, we should be able to issue letters of credit from an uncommitted facility.



However, sections 4.1(d) of each of  the West LB Facility and the Chase Facility contain a representation that Enron Corp.'s financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. This representation was false when made, and will always be false. Thus, there is an issue with an officer being able to make the representations and warranties necessary for an issuance of a letter of credit under one of these facilities [or for an extension of an existing letter of credit]. 



In order to utilize the committed facilities, it will be necessary to obtain an amendment or waiver of this representation, since simply adjusting the representation on an officer's certificate gives the agent a defense to issuance on the face of the certificate. [An amendment is preferable from Enron's perspective.] [Note that as we previously discussed, there is not an event of default under the facilities, since that provision has a materiality qualifier.]
Thank you to those who attended the Documentation Committee meeting in New

York on November 29. We look forward to meeting our European members at the

STRONG BUY

Target Price: 54.00 (US$)

Dynegy Inc. (DYN)

ENE Deal Shows Risk Coverage & Est & Valuation Upside



Summary



After the close on Friday, DYN confirmed that it would acquire Enron (ENE, 8.63,

Strong Buy) for 0.2685 DYN shares plus assumption of debt and an equity infusion

of $2.5 billion. This values ENE at $10.40 per share based on DYN's Friday

close.



Our initial analyses show the merger to be additive to pro-forma '02 eps for DYN

by 25% to $3.25-$3.30 vs our current estimate of $2.55. We estimate the deal

multiples as about 7x '02 eps, 3.2x '02 cash flow, 0.85x book value and 5x

EV/EBITDA based on our revised '02 estimates for ENE.



We would note that DYN has projected a pro-forma '02 of $3.40-$3.50 per share

before cost savings and synergies.



We expect the deal to close in 9-12 months pending reviews by the SEC, FTC, FERC

and state PSCs. Despite the size of the combined company, we do not expect major

divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and

the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business.



In a report dated Nov 5, we valued ENE at $31 per share. In our view, the deal

valuation includes a differential of $20 per share or $17 billion to account for

ENEs related party and accounting issues. Because these issues threatened ENEs

core businesses, the timing and valuation of the deal for DYN is extraordinarily

attractive. We consider alternate bids for ENE to be possible under these

circumstances.



We expect DYN and other energy merchants to benefit from the removal of risk

that ENE would be downgraded below investment grade or file for bankruptcy

protection.



Pending additional information from conference calls, analyst meetings and other

deal related filings; we are maintaining our reported eps ests for DYN of $2.10

for '01 and $2.55 for '02. Our ENE ests are $1.80 for '01 and $1.60 for '02.

These estimates assume the deal closes in 4Q'02.

We maintain our Strong Buy rating for DYN with a target price of $54. We

anticipate growth rate and valuation benefits for DYN that will result in

increasing our estimates and target price as the deal moves closer to closing.

I think you need to coordinate with Kevin Howard and Drew Fossum.   I will be out of the office tomorrow.
Frank has just noted that there is one exception (NNG/TW) to the rates on the attached schedule.  In the case of CIAC paid to others, the intent is to amortize it over

the life of the contract and if there is no contract, it would default to 10%.
FYI - If this should happen, we should include it in the July Flash and also the Quarterly Functional Forecast (as a part of FA&A activity, right ???).
Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.



This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.



Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  



Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:

?   Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International

?   Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS

?   Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners

?   Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric

?   John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix

?   Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp

?   Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water

?   Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind



With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:

?   Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 

?   Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 

?   Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction

?   Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS

?   Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO

?   John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR    

?   Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources



In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.



Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  



Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

Tracy,

 

Only the Ad Val and Tax Compliance groups intend to charge clean fuels.  If Methanol is the only thing left and it is Corporate, then the charges would stay on the Corp. tax cost centers instead of being charged to ETS.  Thanks for your information.  This will not change your 2002 allocations since I had not included the Clean Fuels charges.

redo = redo each of the fiancials i/s, b/s, c/f and supporting items pulling out the impact of trailblazer, so that the financials presented only reflect nng the legal entity
Per your request we have checked the MMF calculation data for NNG/TW/FGT/Trailblazer to Hyperion and/or SAP as appropriate.  Data checks out.

However, I asked Mary to provide me a copy of the prior year calculation.  It appears that the NNG and TW Fair Value Adjustment companies were included in the calculation this year, but were excluded last year.  A ballpark estimate is that the ETS MMF factor would drop by .1% if the NNG/TW fair value companies were excluded as they were last year.   That would mean a factor of 19.0% rather than 19.1%.





Please call me when you want to discuss IMP.  I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for so trying to answer by e-mail probably wouldn't be very productive.

In mid-2001, Doug was named the firm's Chief Equity Strategist and is responsible for stock selection and development of equity themes. Doug completed the CFA designation in 1997. He has a BS in accounting and an MBA from the University of Richmond. 



We have scheduled a 30 minute call with Mr. Sandler in which he will share his thoughts on the overall markets and answer a few questions.

Let me know when and where.
As you might recall, York filed two summonses against Enron and Eric Holzer in two separate lawsuits' connected with the parties' dealings in the paper market. The two summonses (as allowed by Pennsylvania law) lacked any information about York's claims against Enron or Mr. Holzer. The Enron defendants removed their suits to federal court. Dechert is the Enron defendants' outside counsel.  

    We have finally received York's complaint detailing its claims against Enron and Mr. Holzer.  In a nutshell, York claims that Enron hired Holzer away from York in an effort to steal York's customer base and then, contrary to the parties' agreement and custom in the industry, proceeded to steal customers from York. Specifically, York claims that the only reason it let Holzer out of his non-compete agreement with York is because both Holzer and Enron promised: that they would honor the allegedly established practice in the paper industry preventing competitors from usurping each other's client relationships by selling paper directly to each other's clients, and that York would get new business from Enron. It is York's position that Holzer took confidential and proprietary information from York when he left that company, gave this information to Enron and that Enron and Holzer used this information to wrongfully steal York's customers. 

    York has alleged causes of action against Enron and Holzer for:

    1.  Theft of trade secrets,

    2.  Breach of contract (several counts),

    3.  Tortuous interference with contractual relations,

    4.  Tortuous interference with prospective contractual relations,

    5.  Fraudulent inducement,

    6.  Unfair competition, and 

    7.  Civil conspiracy.

    My initial impression is that York should be more worried about having agreements with its competitors preventing business solicitation then Enron should be worried about a predatory pricing claim; however, I don't know enough about the facts to have a firm view of the case. We are in the process of getting more information about these claims and I'll update you again after we have talked to our folks about this.  In the meantime, please call with any questions or comments.
What is our cash needs over the week to ten days? Ned for mcmahon meeting at 1.

RESULTS OF LAST WEEK'S POLL:

Would you lend your biometric info to a friend?

51.4% Yes

48.6% No



***PORTAL DISCUSSION***

A recent survey has found that 56% percent of people would be willing to share their fingerprint or eyeball identification to enter public or corporate buildings, while 35% are concerned about sacrificing their privacy for better security. Why is this? 



Here's what you're saying:

Passwords are readily transferable. You introduce biometrics to eliminate sharing. This can be made impossible by storing biometrics on a secure token and implementing a token match process. No database storage required!! Then only you can access your entitlement. Simple!



I think somehow that you have missed the point. Using biometrics to limit administrative access on your network would work using your simple proposition but the question refers more to the problem of physical access. Maybe you can explain how creating a cookie will help if someone decides to let someone else into their office block by putting their finger in the biometric device and holding the door open for the other person to come in as well.

ETS is developing a web-based Emergency Response Information (ERI) system to provide access to employee contact information including work phone, home phone, cell phone, fax number and pager numbers. To facilitate and manage the collection of personal contact data, a new field has been added to eHRonline. Beginning Monday, October 1, all ETS employees will be prompted to either ACCEPT or DECLINE publication of personal data (i.e., home phone number) when first entering the eHRonline system. All ETS employees should access the eHRonline system at their first opportunity to respond to this new request.



While certain positions within ETS mandate disclosure of personal contact data (i.e., home phone number) for emergency response purposes, in other cases disclosure of this information is at the discretion of the employees. If you are an ETS Operations employee and do not want your home phone number published, please contact your Director prior to electing not to publish your personal contact information. 



To access eHRonline, go to the ETS HRWeb link: https://ehronline.enron.com/ and select eHRonline. Employees must enter their SAP Personnel Number and Password to enter the system.  If you do not know your SAP Personnel Number or Password, please contact the Integrated Solutions Center at (713)-345-4727.
No.  No.  No.  We do not want to tell MSN until after they are formally served.  To bolster our venue argument, we want to make sure they don't have chance to file a lawsuit before they are served. We can call them literally one minute after formal service has been accomplished.

Updates on Enron / Dynegy Merger, SCE Rescue Plan and Muni Vote in San Fran=



cisco











By Will McNamara



Director, Electric Industry Analysis











[Today's column includes analysis on three separate news items.]=20







EnronOnline and Dynegydirect to Merge=20







[News item from Energy Info Source] Online energy trading EnronOnline will =



merge with smaller rival Dynegydirect after its parent company Enron Corp. =



agreed to a $9-billion takeover by Dynegy Inc. The integration of the two p=



latforms will take about six to nine months, Dynegy said. In the meantime, =



the two will continue to operate separately. On both EnronOnline and Dynegy=



direct, traders can only deal with Enron and Dynegy, respectively.=20







Analysis: This is the first step in what may ultimately be a challenging in=



tegration of the various businesses between Dynegy and Enron. Although the =



merger makes sense for both companies, especially considering Enron's finan=



cial instability and its limited options at this juncture, it must be ackno=



wledged that the two companies have very different corporate cultures, and =



the process of conjoining those different cultures may be a major task. The=



 companies have developed two distinct approaches to online trading, as ill=



ustrated by their independent electronic exchanges. Although it will be int=



eresting to see how the separate exchanges become conjoined and assimilate =



their two separate customer accounts, one thing that EnronOnline and Dynegy=



direct have in common is that they rely on principal-based transactions.=20







It is important to note that Enron gained the first-strike advantage when i=



t developed EnronOnline, the first electronic-trading exchange, well ahead =



of its competitors. Dynegy later followed this trend and created Dynegydire=



ct about a year later. The latest available information indicates that Enro=



nOnline has recorded transactions that exceed $590 billion in notional valu=



e. Since its inception in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 bill=



ion in notional transactions. Enron trades various commodities on EnronOnli=



ne, led by electricity and natural gas, but also including bandwidth and pa=



per. EnronOnline is a proprietary trading exchange. In other words, in ever=



y transaction that takes place on EnronOnline, Enron participates as either=



 a buyer or a seller.=20







Dynegydirect was launched in October 2000, a year after EnronOnline became =



operational. Dynegydirect is much smaller than EnronOnline, although it is =



growing. The exchange recorded nearly $10 billion in transactions in the th=



ird quarter. Like EnronOnline, Dynegydirect is also principal-based. In oth=



er words, Dynegy is a participant in all of the transactions, either as a b=



uyer or a seller. Unlike EnronOnline, which is completely online, Dynegydir=



ect allows customers to conduct their transactions with Dynegy over the tel=



ephone. It is important to note that Dynegy strategically became involved i=



n two different kinds of online trading. The first is the proprietary, one-=



to-many format on Dynegydirect, in which Dynegy participates in all transac=



tions as either a buyer or a seller. The second venue is an anonymous, many=



-to-many format in which Dynegy participates along with multiple buyers and=



 sellers. This operation takes place on TradeSpark. Dynegy had previously i=



nvested $25 million in eSpeed, the trading systems developer that created t=



he infrastructure on which TradeSpark operates.=20







As a whole, the online trading market appears to be riding the wave of a ma=



jor growth spurt. A study conducted by AMR Research showed that 600 energy-=



trading exchanges existed in April 2000. This number grew to 1,500 by Septe=



mber 2001. A separate report conducted by Forrester Research indicates that=



 online trading in wholesale markets increased 750 percent from 1999 to 200=



0. The same report projects that online trading volume will continue to gro=



w, leaping from a $400-billion market in 2000 to a $3.6-trillion market in =



2005. Without question, the combined force of Enron and Dynegy will gain a =



market edge in many sectors of the energy industry, including the online tr=



ading market.=20











SCE Allowed to Proceed with Rescue Plan=20







[News item from Energy Info Source] A federal judge on Nov. 9 refused to de=



lay a settlement between Southern California Edison (SCE) and state regulat=



ors designed to allow the utility to recover $3.3 billion of its debts and =



to keep it from bankruptcy. U.S. District Judge Ronald Lew said delaying th=



e deal, as requested by a consumer group, would risk harming the state's se=



cond-largest utility, its creditors and the public. Judge Lew, who approved=



 the settlement on Oct. 5, called the arguments for a stay advanced by cons=



umer group The Utility Reform Network (TURN) repetitive and without meri=



t.=20







Analysis: This is a victory for SCE in the painstaking process of establish=



ing a rescue plan for the utility with the state of California. Two weeks a=



go, a federal appeals court had temporarily blocked a settlement between SC=



E and state power regulators that would keep electric rates at record highs=



 for the next two years. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted TURN=



 two weeks to argue against the settlement. The settlement would help SCE, =



the state's second-largest utility, pay more than half of its estimated $6-=



billion debt by continuing to charge Edison customers higher rates imposed =



last May. The judge's decision now has blocked any additional counter claim=



s by TURN, at least on the current judicial level, and it appears that SCE =



is free to move forward with its CPUC-endorsed rescue plan.=20







It is important to note that the original settlement deal between SCE and t=



he state of California emerged out of negotiations that had taken place bet=



ween SCE and the CPUC in an effort to resolve previous litigation. SCE had =



sued state regulators at the CPUC after they refused to allow the utility t=



o raise rates and recover billions of dollars it had spent buying power on =



behalf of customers at soaring prices in the wholesale market. SCE's lawsui=



t argued that the regulators broke federal law and unconstitutionally took =



its property by not letting it bill customers for the full cost of their el=



ectricity. At the present time, SCE's total debt is marked at about $6.35 b=



illion in power procurement-related liabilities due to state law that prohi=



bited it from recovering the high costs of wholesale electricity through re=



tail electric rates. Under the agreement reached between SCE and the CPUC, =



SCE would be allowed to pay down about $3 billion of its back debt of $6.35=



 billion.=20







In exchange for being protected from bankruptcy proceedings, SCE agreed to =



a rate freeze and a promise by utility executives to not pay shareholders a=



 dividend until the debt is paid off. SCE's rates were raised by approximat=



ely 42 percent in 2001 and will remain frozen through 2003 unless the utili=



ty pays off its debts sooner. In exchange, SCE agreed it would use cash on =



hand and any revenue beyond what it needs to cover operating expenses to pa=



y off its old debts; pay no dividends on its common stock through 2003 or u=



ntil its back debts are fully paid; and drop a lawsuit against state regula=



tors claiming the CPUC had violated federal law by failing to raise retail =



rates to reflect the underlying cost of wholesale power. From its perspecti=



ve, officials at Edison International (the parent company of SCE) expressed=



 confidence that the settlement deal would allow the utility to accumulate =



enough cash and gain financing by the middle of the first fiscal quarter of=



 2002 to pay its debt to banks, bondholders and power generators.=20











Tally of Absentee Ballots Changes San Francisco Municipalization Vote=20







[News item from Reuters] Two ballot measures aimed at establishing a public=



 power system in San Francisco and unplugging utility Pacific Gas & Electri=



c Co. have gone down in defeat, officials said on Nov. 12.=20







Analysis: The tally of absentee ballots in the Nov. 6 municipalization vote=



 in San Francisco changed at least part of the outcome in this election. As=



 noted in a previous IssueAlert, Proposition I, which sought to set up a Mu=



nicipal Utility District in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane, was def=



eated. However, originally it was believed that the separate measure known =



as Proposition F, which would have established a Municipal Water and Power =



Agency in San Francisco alone, had passed by a slim margin. Upon counting t=



he absentee ballots, the San Francisco Department of Elections announced th=



at this measure was defeated by a scant 533 votes.=20







Obviously, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is quite pleased with the revised out=



come of this election. In response to the finalized vote, representatives f=



rom the utility said, This outcome affirms that there is no strong sentime=



nt in favor of the takeover of PG&E's distribution system in San Francisco.=



 There may be some validity to this statement, considering that one could =



argue that with the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & Electric and the recent Cal=



ifornia energy crisis, conditions could have favored a pro-municipalization=



 vote, and yet the measure still failed. However, let's not forget that it =



was defeated by only 533 votes, which indicates that the issue regarding th=



e establishment of a public power system in the area is far from over.=20







The defeat of the municipalization issue in San Francisco can be attributed=



 to several factors. First, it must be acknowledged that PG&E Corp., the pa=



rent company of bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric, spent about $1 million on =



advertising to defeat the measure. However, arguably voters responded to cl=



aims by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. that the municipalization plan was unrea=



listic. The utility claimed that a (MUD) Municipal Utility would be ill-equ=



ipped to handle the complex electricity infrastructure that Pacific Gas & E=



lectric has managed for years, and that a city-run bureaucracy would not be=



 able to compete with big league energy players. In addition, the new MUD w=



ould have to purchase Pacific Gas & Electric's transmission assets and also=



 buy wholesale power without the benefit of long-term contracts, which repr=



esent two hefty investments that would end up costing consumers in the long=



 run.=20

EPPI Claim for 2000-2001



Enron Processing Properties, Inc (EPPI)  assignment of the GPM Agency Agreement committed EPPI to reimburse KN (now Oneok) for all-in transportation rates above 4.45%.  NNG's must bill minimum rates and those rates are sometimes above the 4.45% all-in rate, therefore Oneok has submitted invoices for transport excesses of $79,165 and $222,315 for the years 2000 and 2001.



The invoices are currently being checked by Gas Logistics and once a final determination has been made coding instructions will be needed for this EPPI commitment.





Prior Claim (1997-1999)



On 2/18/2000, KN submitted a claim for $363,211 covering 1997-1999, I checked the calculations and the claim was revised to $192,000.



During negotiations KN sold the agreements to Oneok and to my knowledge the prior claim was never paid nor were any more demands for payments made.

TO:     ISDA Credit Derivatives Market Practice Committee 



FROM:   Louise Marshall (lmarshall@isda.org); Katia D'Hulster

(kdhulster@isda-eur.org)



DATE:       December 4, 2001



RE:     Emerging Markets Subcommittee - Response Requested







Please note that ISDA is in the process of forming an Emerging Markets

Subcommittee of the Credit Derivatives Market Practice Committee. 



Anyone interested in joining this subcommittee should forward FULL details

to Scott Marra at this return address by COB, Monday December 10.
I am pleased to announce that Jana Domke has accepted the position of Director, Compensation for Enron Transportation Services, effective August 1, 2001.



Jana started with Enron in May, 2000 and most recently has been Director of Compensation & Benefits for Enron Wind.  Prior to joining Enron, Jana was a Practice Leader with PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Director, International Compensation & Benefits for Smith International.  Jana has 19 years of experience in both domestic and international compensation and benefits.



Jana received her M.B.A. from the University of Houston.  She also has a Bachelors Degree from U of H in Organizational Behavior & Management.



Jana can be reached at (713) 853-6329 and her office location is EB1156.  The ETS Compensation staff, including Jana's direct reports, can be viewed on the attached organization chart.



Please join me in welcoming Jana to the ETS team.
We  reached a conceptual agreement with the government representatives on Sunday night.  The main points are:  



     1. Rationing losses:   Defined methodology giving distribution companies recovery over the next 36 months of rationing losses realised   from June 01 until the end of rationing in 02. Recovery includes financial compensation. Immediate funding of 80% through BNDES, with Brazilian government funds. Loans liquidated over the 3 year period as tariff increases are realised.  Funding scheduled by December 15th.  Elektro Ebitda impact of approximately R$191million or US$ 73 million.



       2.  April/May MAE settlement :   Market will settle under current rules due to pre-rationing conditions, confirming the procedures used on Elektro's books.  Impact of approximately R$ 18 million or US$ 7 million. 



       3.  Parcel  A for the future:  All non-controlable costs to which LDC's are subjected to including power purchases, sector charges, are passed through to final tariffs either using a tracking account mechanism or by aligning adjustment dates with  the LDC tariff revision date.  Tracking account will be subject to financial compensation from the date costs are incurred until the effective pass through and collection , eliminating a major risk for the distribution sector. Elektro Ebitda impact  2002 forward of R$ 60 million or US$ 19 million, as had been considered in the 2002 plan.  This methodology represents major risk mitigation going forward, as the initial power supply contracts are renewed starting in 2003.



        4. Parcel A from the past:   Min Parente has agreed to the concept recovering non controllable  that were not passed through to tariffs since late 1999 using the same methodology agreed to for future recoveries and has a dedicated team from the Federal Attorney General's office targeting a final solution in ten days.    Elektro impact  is R$145 million or US$ 55 million in 2001. The proposed mechanism for recovery is after the 36 months for the rationing losses.  



We are currently finalising a memo of understanding and the government team is winding up the settlement with the generators in order to finalize the terms of the overall agreement.



Min Parente has committed to resolving the open issues affecting investors in the power sector.  These  agreements represent a major step forward, significantly improving  the value of our businesses. By  solving the pending issues for the rationing losses, thus eliminating the Annex 5 controversy the MAE should function normally, allowing us to operate Eletrobolt and settle against the pool.  



Total amounts for the sector represent about R$ 10 billion or US$3.8 billion at the current rates.  Our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the rationing, and have been instrumental in convincing the government of the need for implementing these changes.
We are turning into Corp today, (3CE), (34.9).  This is a variance of (8.3) to what you have below.



NEPCO = (8.5) - due to project profit adjustments on LS Power/Kendall, IL, Cogentrix/Jenks, OK, and E.Coast Power/Linden, NJ.

EEOS =      .2 - Puerto Rico 2.0, Bonus accrual (1.0), and misc. other (.8).



FYI,  We are currently looking at the NEPCO projects to see if they require further writedowns.



Are we reporting the 4Q through EGS and not Wholesale?  Please let me know.

The latest from a discussion with Rod, Mary Kay and Dave N. this morning:





FA&A will carry the depreciation - targets may be adjusted for yr to yr increase



IMP and FAS 106 will  be carried at FA&A ,Potential offsets to yr to yr increases are yet to be  determined.





Thus, the above items will not be put into the NNG Commercial Adaytum model.
We will be down $2.0MM which is the corporate relief that Lindsay promised us.



That puts EREC at $51.2 IBIT
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.



Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.



I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.



Thank you.

  John, I have prepared a more formal position regarding the exemption of Compressor Fuel consumed in a continuing business activity (Gas services).  Before I submit this position to you, I will circulate my position letter within the company and validate the facts.  

I will be relying primarily on Colorado Regulations 26-102.21 or 39-26-104.1(d.1).  Have these regulations changed recently?  My service may be out of date.

Attached below are schedules for Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption for the audit period.

Dan,



Here is my initial response.  I haven't had time to do too much research on

this, but this preliminarily the Department's position.  Sorry this took so

long  but I am working on a bankruptcy case which has my first priority.  jp

If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing

might agree.  But, the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash.

I don't believe that the statute and regulation support that position.

Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service

to qualify for the exemption.  I don't believe it does.  I definitely need

more research on this.

Hi Tracy,

I was wondering if you had sent anybody at PGE the format (file

Dee is out of the office for a week, so if you sent it to him I wouldn't

So, I can't tell what my exposure is here.  Which line do I use?



The maximum shown on the schedule is $1.1MM   (expand column width on Column A).   Although it looks from the spreadsheet as if $300 to $600K may be more realistic for the compressor fuel tax through 4/01.  However, there could be $11K/month going forward. 



The other issue would be the sales tax on our purchase of personal property from NWP.  Whatever that may turn out to be, it should not be an earnings concern, but would be capitalized as part of the plant.  



If you need more specificity, I suggest you give Dan a call.

I'm sure Jerry is aware of this.  He isn't Dan's boss, but they're in the same CC and only a couple of cubes away in the Jefferson bldg.   

I don't think we have any reserves/accruals for these on the TW balance sheet.

Attached is a draft of the letter to Corporate Counsel re solicitation of EWS employees.
Attached is a file showing depreciation for NNG Commercial after excluding depreciation for the capital dollars associated with rate case settlement (lines 13-16).  The 2002 depreciation is calculated to be $4.379 million.  



I think philosophically it s a good idea to track capital projects within NNG Commercial based on the life of the contracts used to justify the project.  I don't think Neubauer is quite there yet.  



My concern is that we have developed an IBIT  target for 2002 by using a 2001 number that does not include depreciation.  It seems that we ought to offset the 01 starting point by the amount of the 02 depreciation.  Lets talk further with Rod.
I gather that Bob will be spending most of his time on the securities litigation.  Is it still possible to get a litigation manager to  handle EES matters.  I would hope we could use one of the EWS litigators, as we discussed earlier.  Having someone on the floor would be a definite plus as well. I had talked to Andy but  never finalized because of the crisis situation we are in.  My main concern is that the EES business not be allocated among numerous litigators so that we do have accountability  or take a back seat to other assignments.  Thanks.
This is Saunders entire world plus Borcyk's world for tax.   Accounting and Reporting are consolidated, not worth splitting and the cost estimate should be a net Enron estimate.



Call Kirk Stevens for the Portland info and Tod (unless you know who else) for the EREC world.   What about Wessex?

Jim Fallon asked me to forward this article on Ken Rice's new venture.











New startup proposes global virtual services



Marlene Tissot



12 November 2001=20



A project to build a global network for multimedia services, based entirely=



 on switched virtual circuits (SVCs), has been revealed to CWI. And it inte=



nds to prove the value of connectionless network services for customers by =



carrying output from the Olympic Games in Beijing around the world. While n=



ew carriers are counting their cash and hoping to hold the fort until the m=



arket turns around, SynerG Communications Ltd., believes it can prove to ev=



erybody that it is still possible to launch an ambitious telecoms business,=



 even in these harsh times. Backed by an Asian media mogul that prefers to =



keep a low profile, as well as an equipment vendor and a network operator i=



n the United States, its founders claim SynerG already has verbal commitmen=



ts from customers amounting to $100 million in revenues. And they say they =



are negotiating to gain rights to carry multimedia content from the Beijing=



 Olympics in 2008. SynerG's business plan is based on a relatively uncommon=



 way to deliver bandwidth. Ken Rice, the chairman and founder of California=



-based International SynerG Communications Holdings Ltd., says that potenti=



al cost savings for end-users will be compelling because they will be able =



to provision bandwidth on an ad hoc basis, giving them so-called bandwidth =



on demand. A 41-node global ATM-based switched virtual circuit network will=



 focus on delivering content across Asia, Europe and North America. Under m=



ost existing contracts, customers pay for leased-line capacity they do not =



actually use, according to Rice, who claims his project is significantly di=



fferent. It's a utility-based network, says Rice. (It) generates billing=



 for what is used, not what is contracted for as in fixed line configuratio=



ns. But while end users are increasingly scrutinizing their spend, they ha=



ve also grown accustomed to always-on fat pipes and will need reassurance o=



f the constant availability of the circuits. If you are a customer, you ne=



ed to be sure that the capacity is there at all time, says Maureen Coulter=



, a senior analyst at Gartner Group in Egham, England. SVCs are appropriat=



e for content as long as the service provider manages the quality of transp=



ort for the end-user. SynerG claims that this quality of service will be e=



nsured by employing Pathfinder, its proprietary network management software=



. And the business plan for SynerG shows Lucent Technologies and AT&T among=



 its suppliers and shareholders. Lucent has taken a 2.11% equity stake, and=



 a network provisioning deal gives AT&T a possible equity option. AT&T has =



experience marketing SVCs in the U.S., although in the case of SynerG it is=



 thought only to be providing bandwidth from its global network. There migh=



t also be something in the new network business model for SynerG's circuit =



supplier. Even if revenues from providing the circuits to SynerG are not im=



mense, neither is the risk the carrier takes by doing it, since it gets a r=



evenue share each time bandwidth is used by a customer. While the cost of o=



ffering such a service is moderate, it may provide a new stream of revenue =



for carriers. It's something I expect we'll see more and more, said Gartn=



er's Coulter. In the content distribution market ... carriers want to sque=



eze every penny out of their capacity. To make sure it can guarantee deliv=



ery to consumers, SynerG says it will operate a 41-node ATM-based switched =



virtual circuit network in nine European countries and 23 city networks in =



the U.S., according to its business plan. Operations will be headed up by c=



hief executive Fred Metzgen, a former business development director for BT =



Syncordia Global Solutions, who will be based in Newport Beach, California.=



 Metzgen has been touring Europe and the U.S. to get the $10-million startu=

So, I can't tell what my exposure is here.  Which line do I use?

The maximum shown on the schedule is $1.1MM   (expand column width on Column A).   Although it looks from the spreadsheet as if $300 to $600K may be more realistic for the compressor fuel tax through 4/01.  However, there could be $11K/month going forward. 

The other issue would be the sales tax on our purchase of personal property from NWP.  Whatever that may turn out to be, it should not be an earnings concern, but would be capitalized as part of the plant.  

If you need more specificity, I suggest you give Dan a call.

I'm sure Jerry is aware of this.  He isn't Dan's boss, but they're in the same CC and only a couple of cubes away in the Jefferson bldg.   

I don't think we have any reserves/accruals for these on the TW balance sheet.

John, I have prepared a more formal position regarding the exemption of Compressor Fuel consumed in a continuing business activity (Gas services).  Before I submit this position to you, I will circulate my position letter within the company and validate the facts.  

I will be relying primarily on Colorado Regulations 26-102.21 or 39-26-104.1(d.1).  Have these regulations changed recently?  My service may be out of date.

Attached below are schedules for Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption for the audit period.

Dan,

Here is my initial response.  I haven't had time to do too much research on

this, but this preliminarily the Department's position.  Sorry this took so

long  but I am working on a bankruptcy case which has my first priority.  jp

If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing

might agree.  But, the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash.

I don't believe that the statute and regulation support that position.

Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service

to qualify for the exemption.  I don't believe it does.  I definitely need

more research on this.

Calpine Corp. Becomes One of the Few Companies to Penetrate Florida's Whole=



sale Market















By Will McNamara



Director, Electric Industry Analysis











[News item from Reuters] San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine Corp. (NYSE: CPN) a=



nnounced that it has begun construction of its planned 530-MW Osprey power =



plant in Auburndale, Fla. The plant, known as the Osprey Energy Center, is =



expected to begin commercial operation in late 2003, according to company s=



tatements. Calpine said in June that it had received Florida's regulatory a=



pproval for the plant, and that it was expected to cost $250 million to bui=



ld. Calpine also said that it is continuing to move forward with the prop=



osed 1,080-MW Blue Heron Energy Center, slated for Indian River County, Fla=



.=20







Analysis: With the onset of construction on this plant, Calpine now reporte=



dly ranks as one of the few out-of-state generating companies that has been=



 able to penetrate Florida's wholesale power market. Other companies such a=



s Enron have made similar attempts to begin construction on new plants (or =



gain control over existing plants), only to be blocked by community and reg=



ulatory resistance. Calpine, which now ranks as the largest builder of powe=



r plants in North America, has gained entry into Florida by agreeing to sel=



l the output from the plant to one of Florida's existing utilities. Neverth=



eless, it is a concession that supports Calpine's larger strategy for expan=



sion, both within Florida and across the United States. Along with the Ospr=



ey and Blue Heron facilities, Calpine also plans to eventually build a 1,08=



0-MW, $500-million plant near Vero Beach, Fla., which certainly positions t=



he company as the leading out-of-state generator in Florida's rather cloist=



ered wholesale market.=20







It is important to note that the Osprey Energy Center, which will be a comb=



ined-cycle, natural gas-fired facility, will be the first power plant of it=



s kind to be built by an independent power producer (IPP) in Florida under =



the state's stringent Power Plant Siting Act. There are some fundamental as=



pects of Florida's $13-billion electric market that should be established f=



or context. First, Florida represents the third-largest electric market in =



the United States in terms of consumption (193 million megawatt-hours, acco=



rding to the Energy Information Administration), so deregulation of the sta=



te remains of great importance to many stakeholders. However, Florida has t=



aken a go slow approach toward electric competition and, at this point, t=



here is no plan to initiate retail competition in Florida. Leaders of the s=



tate (including Gov. Jeb Bush) have supported competition in the state's wh=



olesale market in an effort to move cautiously toward total deregulation. F=



lorida's Energy 2020 Study Commission, which is preparing the blueprint for=



 competition in the state, endorsed a plan to allow out-of-state companies =



to enter Florida's wholesale market by building new plants and selling powe=



r to the state's incumbent utilities.=20







However, the Florida Supreme Court has banned out-of-state companies from b=



uilding merchant plants in the state, which would be free to sell power any=



where and are not subject to rate regulation by the state's regulatory comm=



ission. A good example of this is Enron, which has attempted several times =



to build new generation facilities in the state. A proposed plant in Pompan=



o Beach, Fla., was rejected amid strong community resistance. Enron was giv=



en governmental approval to proceed with a peaking unit in Deerfield Beach,=



 Fla., for which the company is still attempting to obtain air quality perm=



its. According to Enron, the Deerfield Beach plant was approved because it =



was classified as a peaking unit, and will be allowed to generate only duri=



ng times of peak demand. It is not known at this time if Enron will continu=



e with its plans to build this plant now that it is being acquired by Dyneg=



y Inc. Southern Company has also moved into Florida (its first expansion ou=



tside of its service area) after receiving preliminary approval to build a =



633-MW natural-gas generation facility in Orlando. Southern Company has agr=



eed to sell the total output from this plant in a 10-year contract with the=



 Orlando Utilities Commission, Kissimmee Utility Authority and Florida Muni=



cipal Power Agency.=20







Nevertheless, the important point is that Florida has been a notoriously di=



fficult state for outside generating companies to enter and obtain permissi=



on to build new generating facilities. Florida law does allow out-of-state =



companies to build peaker plants, as long as they only operate in times of =



especially high demand when normal supplies are strained. Some new plants a=



re small enough as to not need approval from the Florida Public Service Com=



mission, although they still must obtain approval related to zoning laws an=



d air pollution permits. One proposal under the 2020 plan has suggested eli=



minating the involvement of the governor and the State Cabinet in approving=



 proposed plants, and limiting the ability of local governments to block pr=



ojects.=20







There are two factors that enabled Calpine to gain approval to proceed with=



 the Osprey plant. First, Calpine seemingly has signed a long-term contract=



 to sell the output of the plant to Seminole Electric Cooperative under a l=



ong-term contract, which meets the Supreme Court standard that out-of-state=



 generators cannot build merchant plants. Second, Seminole is a public util=



ity and outside of the jurisdiction of the Florida Public Service Commissio=



n, which presumably made it easier for Calpine to gain access into the stat=



e. Seminole Electric is a generation and transmission cooperative headquart=



ered in Tampa, Fla. It provides bulk supplies of electricity and wholesale =



energy services to 10 cooperatives located throughout peninsular Florida. A=



s of December 2000, more than 1.5 million business and residential consumer=



s in 45 counties received electric service from Seminole and its members. A=



ccording to information from Seminole, the bulk of its generating reserves =



is provided through a 20-year agreement with Calpine, which runs through 20=



13. Additional terms of the contract were not disclosed.=20







The Osprey facility will be located next to Calpine's existing 150-MW cogen=



eration facility in Auburndale, Fla., where a new 115-MW simple-cycle peaki=



ng unit is also under construction and expected to come online next year. R=



egarding the planned 1,080-MW plant near Vero Beach, Fla. Calpine reportedl=



y has found buyers for about one-half of the power it would produce from th=



e plant, enough to obtain the necessary state permits. This plant could be =



under construction by the end of next year. Calpine also opened a Tampa off=



ice in 2000 to support its expansion in Florida and the Southeast, which in=



dicates that the company intends to remain a major player in this region, w=



hich has been comparatively slow to embrace electric deregulation.=20







Further, Calpine participates in a group known as the Florida Partnership f=



or Affordable Competitive Electricity (Florida PACE), which has attempted t=



o persuade lawmakers in the state, including Gov. Jeb Bush, to deregulate F=



lorida's wholesale market. One measure that would help to give the state a =



competitive kick start, or so says the group, would be to allow companies t=



o build new power plants and resell the electricity to retail power sellers=



 such as Florida Power & Light. A final report from the Florida Energy 2020=



 commission, which should address some of these issues, is expected Dec. 1.=



=20







Ironically, public resistance to new power plants in Florida comes at a tim=



e when new reports suggest that the state faces an imminent power supply pr=



oblem. According to representatives from the state's Energy 2020 Study Comm=



ission, Florida's electric reserve is significantly less than the 16-percen=



t reserve that incumbent utilities have claimed exists. In fact, the commis=



sion has found that, without extraordinary management techniques including=



 power disruption, Florida's reserve is 7 percent. It is important to note=



 that the commission is not including interruptible loads in its reserve ca=



lculations. If interruptible load is considered, then Florida most likely d=



oes have a roughly 16-percent electric reserve. Thus, Florida's policy of r=



equiring out-of-state generators to sign long-term contracts with incumbent=



 retailers could be considered a very prudent move, as any new generation t=



hat gets developed in the state is committed to a retail provider (reducing=



 the possibility that power could be withheld to drive up market prices).=



=20







As a whole, Calpine has a generation arsenal that includes some 37,700-MW b=



aseload capacity of mostly natural gas-fired and renewable geothermal resou=



rces. In addition to the baseload generation, Calpine also owns or controls=



 about 8,000 MW of peaking capacity that is presently in operation. Peaking=



 units generally operate in times of especially high demand when normal sup=



plies are strained.=20







As the leading builder of power plants in North America, Calpine is one of =



a small number of generating companies that have banked on a steady increas=



e in demand across the United States, along with the need to supply power d=



uring periods of peak demand. Other companies competing against Calpine in =



this space include Reliant Energy, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy, which coll=



ectively have reportedly announced plans to build some 422,000 MW of genera=



ting capacity over the next 13 years. Calpine specifically has acknowledged=



 that it will buy 27 steam engines from Siemens AG between 2002 and 2005 to=



 build 5,400 MW of generating capacity.=20







Many of these plans for new generating facilities were outlined over the la=



st year or two, when the United States faced a well-publicized energy crunc=



h. Now, the pendulum has swung back to leave many of the same companies wor=



ried about a possible energy glut in which they will have excess power that=



 cannot be sold (or sold at lower-than-anticipated prices). Certainly, a la=



rge portion of the generation planned while supply was compromised and pric=



es were high will be canceled or delayed. However, as one example, Calpine =



appears to be following through with an aggressive generation expansion str=



ategy. One approach that might help Calpine to beat the odds against an ene=



rgy glut is that the company continues to build generation in markets that =



are projected to have continually increasing demand. However, from a broad =



perspective, Calpine may find that, as other companies continue with plans =

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  



As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.

Attached is the revised file.  On the detail pages, I've changed the 2001 CE to $22.2 to match the summary and added the 2001

Plan number.
When was it recovered?  As cash?

Is there not a period of time this can be disputed?  (I thought there was a six month period under Order 581)

Given the significant UAF on TW, why is this gain deemed real, while the others have not?

<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066620996/ref=mk_del_235668_401773040>Hundreds of business and investing books have crossed my desk this year. Below is a list of my favorites. Of these, Jim Collins's Good to Great <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066620996/ref=mk_del_235668_41> is my pick for best business book of the year. The work is the result of five years of research into companies that have delivered extraordinary long-term results. You'll be surprised at not only the companies Collins tags as great, but at the approach they took to achieve their results.

by Jack Welch, John A. Byrne 

It's hard to think of a CEO that commands as much respect as Jack Welch. Under his leadership, General Electric reinvented itself several times over by integrating new and innovative practices, including Six Sigma and the Internet, into its many lines of business. In Jack: Straight from the Gut <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446528382/ref=mk_del_235668_47>, Welch, with the help of John Byrne, talks about his career and the style of management that helped to make GE one of the most successful companies of the last century. Jack: Straight from the Gut <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446528382/ref=mk_del_235668_48> promises to be the most sought-after business book of the year, so don't miss out--order your copy today.

by Juan Enriquez 

This is the most interesting and unique book that I've picked up in a long time. In As the Future Catches You <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609609033/ref=mk_del_235668_53>, Juan Enriquez of the Harvard Business School attempts to capture the trends--genomics in particular--that are shaping our future. Eye-popping typography and graphics coupled with a compact and almost poetic writing style make this thought-provoking book one to savor.

by Christopher Locke 

Count on Chris Locke to poke holes in the conventional thinking that determines how companies relate to their markets. In Gonzo Marketing <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204080/ref=mk_del_235668_58>, Locke takes on the mass-market mindset that defines most big companies and prescribes a new and dangerous way for businesses to interact with customers. Smart and provocative, this book belongs on the shelf of any businessperson looking for a fresh point of view. Locke, who was a coauthor of The Cluetrain Manifesto <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204315/ref=mk_del_235668_59>, has been a longtime customer of Amazon.com. His personal page <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-reviews/-/AH9RPJBDYJQFB/ref=mk_del_235668_60> at Amazon.com is worth a look.

The Myth of Excellence: Why Great Companies Never Try to Be the Best at Everything <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609608207/ref=mk_del_235668_64>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>

by Fred Crawford, Ryan Mathews 

The first thing Fred Crawford and Ryan Mathews asked themselves after surveying 5,000 consumers was how their survey respondents could be so wrong. Their results so upset the conventional thinking about consumer marketing that the two began to reevaluate their assumptions about what American consumers really want--and the results will probably surprise you as well. In The Myth of Excellence, Crawford and Mathews show why values are taking center stage in today's marketplace.

Mark Smith traces the personalities, events, and ideas that have shaped the market, from figures such as Jesse Livermore and Benjamin Graham to events such as the Great Depression and the modern bull market to ideas such as behavioralism and the efficient market theory.

Brand New : How Entrepreneurs Earned Consumers' Trust from Wedgwood to Dell <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578512212/ref=mk_del_235668_72>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>

by Nancy F. Koehn 

In Brand New, Harvard Business School Professor Nancy Koehn looks at six extraordinary brands and the entrepreneurs that built them, from Josiah Wedgwood and Henry Heinz to Howard Schultz and Michael Dell. What interests Koehn is not so much the success these brands enjoyed as much as the trust these household names were able to inspire in consumers. Part business history, part marketing manual, Brand New is a revealing study of brand development that belongs on every thoughtful marketer's bookshelf.

Dan, et al

I guess I'm one of those in management that needs more reasons/clarifications...but...given the reference to no recourse against TW go ahead and let this specific transaction flow thru income. Case closed.



Separately Dan,

It's been stated below that we expect TW UAF to disappear starting in August. By magic?

Generally, I'm not comfortable that we have a handle on gains or losses TW <-there seems to be some control issues here->, and as a result I am not comfortable that we have realizable income. Its likely just a matter of educating yours truly, so, separately set up a meeting w me to lead me thru the flow before we start to bring this reserve into income.
FYI - Here is the latest on the Plan meetings with Lay/Whalley/etc.

Conectiv Completes Nuclear Plant Sales=20















By Will McNamara



Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20











  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>







[News item from PR Newswire] Conectiv (NYSE: CIV), an energy provider locat=



ed in the Mid-Atlantic, announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Atlanti=



c City Electric Company, completed the sale of its ownership interests in t=



hree nuclear plants to PSEG Nuclear LLC and Exelon Generation Company. The =



ownership interests were sold for approximately $11.3 million, excluding re=



imbursement of estimated fuel inventory, subject to adjustment.=20







Analysis: This announcement from Conectiv came out late last week, but I di=



d not want to miss the opportunity to provide some analytical commentary on=



 what I think is a rather significant development. The transfer of ownershi=



p in the three nuclear plants included in this transaction is significant b=



ecause of its relation to Conectiv's unique competitive strategy and the ro=



und-robin way in which nuclear assets are changing hands in the United Stat=



es. Further, despite an increase in acquisition activity around the nation'=



s nuclear facilities, we still are seeing only a small number of companies =



that actually own or control nuclear power in the United States.=20







The divestiture of the nuclear assets includes only what is Conectiv's owne=



rship in the plants, which Conectiv shares with other companies (who also h=



appen to be the buying partners in this sale). The breakdown of the sale of=



 nuclear assets is as follows:=20







A 7.51-percent interest (164 MW) in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station U=



nits 2 and 3 sold in equal shares to co-owners PSEG Nuclear and Exelon. Pri=



or to the transaction, PSEG Nuclear, an indirect subsidiary of Public Servi=



ce Enterprise Group Incorporated, and Exelon each owned about 46 percent of=



 the Peach Bottom plant. Exelon is the operator of the Peach Bottom facilit=



y.=20











A 7.41-percent interest (167 MW) in the Salem Nuclear Generation Station Un=



its 1 and 2 was sold to PSEG Nuclear, which prior to the sale owned about 5=



0 percent of the facility. PSEG Nuclear will remain the operator of the pla=



nt.=20











A 5-percent interest (52 MW) in the Hope Creek Nuclear Generation Station U=



nits 1 and 2 was sold to PSEG Nuclear, which is the operator of the plant a=



nd prior to the sale owned 95 percent of the facility.=20















As noted, the significance of these transactions relates to Conectiv's comp=



etitive strategy and the consolidation that is taking place in the nuclear =



sector. Let's look at Conectiv first.=20







According to Conectiv's President and COO Thomas Shaw, the divestiture of t=



he nuclear assets is consistent with the company's focused business strateg=



y on two core energy businesses: Conectiv Energy, the company's integrated =



generation and asset optimization group, and Conectiv Power Delivery, the c=



ompany's regulated delivery business. To support this two-tiered focus, Con=



ectiv has been in the process of divesting its baseload generating plants t=



o expand a generation portfolio that includes only mid-merit plants (units =



that have more flexibility to follow demand patterns). Mid-merit plants are=



 often viewed as units that fill the operating space between baseload plant=



s and peaker units. Whereas a baseload unit may have a generating capacity =



factor of about 80 percent, a mid-merit unit may have a generating capacity=



 factor of about 30 percent to 55 percent. From Conectiv's perspective, the=



 value of the mid-merit strategy is that these plants can be reserved to op=



erate only when demand is comparatively high. Further, the company believes=



 that mid-merit units are ideally suited to support the company's energy tr=



ading and asset optimization strategy because they are flexible enough to p=



rovide fuel arbitrage opportunities and ancillary service support when they=



 are not needed to meet higher demands for power.=20







The sale of the nuclear assets follows the previous sale of 1,081 MW of bas=



eload generating capacity by Delmarva Power & Light, a subsidiary of Conect=



iv, to NRG Energy and the divestiture of Conectiv's telecommunications busi=



ness (Conectiv Communications) to Cavalier Telephone of Richmond, Va., for =



$20 million. In addition, Conectiv sold its 50-percent stake in a 118-MW co=



-generation facility in New Jersey to Pedricktown Cogeneration LP, a non-ut=



ility electric generator, for $9 million.=20







Conectiv is divesting all of its baseload generation but has maintained own=



ership of some 2,000 MW of mid-merit generation in the Mid-Atlantic region.=



 The proceeds from the coal plant sales to NRG will reportedly be used to r=



epay debt and fund Conectiv's development of additional mid-merit assets. C=



onectiv's immediate goal is to build more than 4,000 MW of mid-merit power =



generation within the Mid-Atlantic region by 2004. Toward that end, Conecti=



v is taking some of the proceeds from the NRG transaction and using the mon=



ey to support a $300-million, 500-MW expansion of its Hay Road Generating S=



tation, which is currently a 516-MW plant that is primarily fueled by natur=



al gas.=20







The divestiture of both the telecommunications business and the baseload ge=



neration supports Conectiv's strategy of re-focusing on its core businesses=



, which are power trading and wholesale marketing (through mid-merit units =



only) and a regulated delivery business. Conectiv Power Delivery provides e=



nergy service to more than one million customers in New Jersey, Delaware, M=



aryland, and Virginia. Given the fairly distinct line between Conectiv's re=



gulated and unregulated businesses, I have previously speculated that Conec=



tiv could be preparing to spin off its unregulated businesses into a stand-=



alone company (a trend represented by AEP, Reliant and UtiliCorp). Conectiv=



 is in the midst of major restructuring, so it is unlikely that any such sp=



in off of its generation business would take place in the near term. Howeve=



r, as far as I know, Conectiv is the only energy company that has focused e=



xclusively on mid-merit plants.=20







Conectiv is also involved in merger proceedings with Pepco, a partnership t=



hat is scheduled to close in April 2002. In this deal, Pepco is acquiring C=



onectiv for a combination of cash and stock valued at $2.2 billion. Both co=



mpanies will become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be named at a =



later date. The partnership between these two relatively small and regional=



ly based utility companies reportedly will create the largest electricity d=



elivery company in the Mid-Atlantic region. By combining their two electric=



ity delivery businesses, Pepco and Conectiv reportedly will more than doubl=



e their customer base and expand their service territory by nine times.=20







In the nuclear sector, it is not terribly surprising that Exelon and PSEG N=



uclear would be the buying partners in the three nuclear plants sold by Con=



ectiv (despite the obvious fact that these companies already maintained maj=



ority ownership in the plants). Exelon and PSEG Nuclear are two of what is =



a small number of companies that are actively involved in the nuclear-power=



 space, and thus it is not surprising that they would be involved in the li=



cense exchange on these three plants. Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet =



in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear ind=



ustry, owning a total of 17 reactors. Earlier this year, Exelon CEO Corbin =



McNeill said he thought that a new nuclear plant would definitely be built =



in the next five years, and did not rule out the fact that his company migh=



t be the one to drive the construction of the new nuclear facility.=20







As noted, PSEG Nuclear is an indirect subsidiary of the Public Service Ente=



rprise Group Inc., which in 2000 was split into PSE&G, a regulated gas and =



electric delivery company in New Jersey and PSEG Power, an unregulated U.S.=



 power generation company. As noted, PSEG Nuclear LLC operates the Salem an=



d Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations in Lower Alloways Creek, N.J., and=



 oversees PSEG Power's ownership interest in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power =



Station, located in Delta, Pa. When the Conectiv transaction is completed, =



PSEG Power will own 100 percent of Hope Creek, 52 percent of Salem, and 50 =



percent of Peach Bottom.=20







In addition to Exelon and PSEG Nuclear, Entergy Corp. is another company th=



at deserves a mention when discussing the nuclear sector. Since 1999, Enter=



gy has been an active bidder on most every nuclear plant that has come onto=



 the auction block. Recently, Entergy bought Con Edison's Indian Point Unit=



s 1 and 2 nuclear power plants in Westchester County, N.Y. In addition, Ent=



ergy recently announced an agreement with the Vermont Yankee Power Corporat=



ion to purchase the 501-MW Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon, Vt=



., for $180 million. With the completion of the Vermont Yankee sale, Enterg=



y will own a nuclear fleet that includes 10 reactors. Also note that the Ne=



w York State Public Service Commission (PSC) just approved the sale of Niag=



ara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating station to Constellation Nuclear =



for about $780 million. The purchase prices for the 614-MW Nine Mile 1 and =



82 percent of the 1,142-MW Nine Mile 2 are about $221 million and $559 mill=



ion, respectively. Constellation is another company that has consistently i=



ncreased its nuclear power assets.=20







Given the volatility of natural gas prices and the high emissions associate=



d with coal-fired generation, many industry analysts have debated whether o=



r not nuclear power is on the brink of resurgence. Exelon, for example, is =



involved in a joint venture that is attempting to commercialize a new nucle=



ar technology called Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR). Supporters of PBMR =



believe its relatively small size (110 MW), anticipated short construction =



time (24 months) and cost ($1,000/kW) can once again make nuclear power an =



acceptable option. In February of 2001, Exelon filed an application with th=



e U.S. nuclear energy regulators to license a similar reactor in the United=



 States. Clearly, steps are being taken to revive this controversial indust=



ry.=20

Regards,
Wade here are the wiring instructions for two payments, one to the CAISO and one to Calpine:



CAISO:



$206,000



This amount represents two days' A/S and GMC charges, plus enough money to bring replenish the 3-day buffer.





Calpine:



$1,980,800



This represents two days' worth of energy to serve our California load.  Our price was $40/MWh.  





By purchasing this energy from Calpine instead of the CAISO, we saved $120/MWh ($60/MWh + $100/MWh underscheduling penalty).



This is a savings of approximately $6 million over the next two days.

Tracy-



I need some help on what this is.  Admittedly, it's only $117k, but we only have 3 employees, and will likely have less next year.  Can we discuss?



Michael













    Tracy Geaccone/ENRON@enronXgate 10/22/01 09:48 AM      To: Mary Botello/ENRON@enronXgate, Tod A Lindholm/ENRON@enronXgate, Agatha B Tran/ENRON@enronXgate, Erin Copeland/ENRON@enronXgate, Michael Anderson/HOU/AZURIX@AZURIX, Jim Barnes/ENRON@enronxgate, Valerie Giles/ENRON@enronxgate  cc:   Subject: FW: 2002 Plan Assessments as of 10/19/01 for EREC
I have a concern about Enron's forward-looking exposure associated with legacy deals (deals that existed during the June 2000 through the May 2001 price shock).  If Edison gets its way, all customers will pay for Edison's under-recovery from June 2000 through January 2001 plus CDWR spot market purchases during 2001.  This would take the form of a surcharge on future bills.  My concern is that Enron will be on the hook for these future charges associated with past under-collections -- even beyond the term of our legacy deals.  For example, if a deal ends in March 2002 we could be on the hook for surcharges that a legacy customer would receive on its bill after that date, provided the surcharge pertained to costs incurred by the utility during the time that the legacy customer was ours.



I have not received clear guidance from legal on this matter.  For example, I asked both Mike Smith and Steve Hall to review the legacy Safeway contract which is on PGES paper.  They both indicated that there is a better chance than not that we are on the hook for these charges, although good arguments could be made that we should not be responsible for them.  Angela Schwarz indicated to me that outside counsel (I'm not sure who) thinks that we are not on the hook for these charges.



It is critical that we get clear guidance from legal on these risks.  We are in front of customers now deciding whether or not to go forward with extensions or terminate contracts after the initial term.  Customers are asking us to make changes to our change in law and utility non-performance provisions.  If we believe that we are wearing the surcharge risks beyond the term of the existing contract and the customer is willing to take those from us in exchange for changes to the master agreement we would probably be willing to do it.  If we aren't currently wearing surcharge risk beyond the term of the existing contract then our negotiating position would be different.



As you all know, the magnitude of this risk is potentially large as our negative CTC receivable is in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  If the CPUC were to adopt Edison's proposal for the entire state, EES' customers would be responsible for surcharges of the same magnitude.  At this point, I don't know whether EES or its customers are on the hook for this risk beyond the term of existing contracts.

    December, 2001

HIGHLIGHTS



*   Viral Genetics has developed a revolutionary new technology called TNP which, based on clinical results to date, not only 

stops but also reverses the progression of HIV infection in people.

*   TNP is an extracted, naturally occurring, biologically active linear protein which, when purified and modified, greatly 

stimulates the body's immune response system.

*   Three months after an eight week TNP treatment, 8 out of 10 terminally ill AIDS patients in clinical trials show virtually no 

sign of HIV infection.

*   TNP treated patients display virtually no side effects to treatment.

*   TNP technology is patented in 16 countries and patent pending in Canada and the U.S.

*   Treatments are far less costly and less cumbersome than currently employed alternatives.



OVERVIEW



Viral Genetics, Inc. was founded in 1995 to develop and commercialize therapeutic and diagnostic systems for the treatment of 

viral diseases.  Their primary focus has been on finding a treatment which would stop and reverse the progression of HIV 

infection in humans.  After expenditures in excess of $8M, Viral Genetics developed their core technology - TNP (Thymus 

Nuclear Protein).



Since TNP's discovery, Viral Genetics has conducted numerous animal studies and three human clinical trials.  Each human trial 

consisted of 10 to 20 patients in the late stages of infection.  TNP was administered by intra-muscular injection bi-weekly over 

an eight week period.  Follow up was carried out on all the patients anywhere from 50 to 667 days after treatment.  The trials 

revealed the following incredible results with respect to TNP's efficacy and safety:



-   HIV viral levels were reduced by 90% even 18 months after treatment.

-   Patients experienced minimal side effects during treatment which completely subsided after treatment and remained that way 

even 18 months after treatment.

-   Dramatic reductions occurred even with HIV resistant strains that no Antiviral Drug Cocktail has shown any efficacy with 

whatsoever.

-   Most patients started to regain body weight during and after TNP treatment.



Viral Genetics is in discussions with a number of world wide governments to commercialize the TNP technology.

diagnostic systems for the treatment of 

viral diseases.  Their primary focus has been on finding a treatment which would stop and 

reverse the progression of HIV 

infection in humans.  After expenditures in excess of $8M, Viral Genetics developed their 

core technology - TNP (Thymus 

Nuclear Protein).



Since TNP's discovery, Viral Genetics has conducted numerous animal studies and three 

human clinical trials.  Each human trial 

consisted of 10 to 20 patients in the late stages of infection.  TNP was administered by intra-

muscular injection bi-weekly over 

an eight week period.  Follow up was carried out on all the patients anywhere from 50 to 

667 days after treatment.  The trials 

revealed the following incredible results with respect to TNP's efficacy and safety:



-   HIV viral levels were reduced by 90% even 18 months after treatment.

-   Patients experienced minimal side effects during treatment which completely subsided 

after treatment and remained that way 

even 18 months after treatment.

-   Dramatic reductions occurred even with HIV resistant strains that no Antiviral Drug 

Cocktail has shown any efficacy with 

whatsoever.

-   Most patients started to regain body weight during and after TNP treatment.



Viral Genetics is in discussions with a number of world wide governments to commercialize 

the TNP technology.

HIGHLIGHTS



*   Viral Genetics has developed a revolutionary new technology called 

TNP which, based on clinical results to date, not only stops but also 

reverses the progression of HIV infection in people.

*   TNP is an extracted, naturally occurring, biologically active linear 

protein which, when purified and modified, greatly stimulates the 

body's immune response system.

*   Three months after an eight week TNP treatment, 8 out of 10 

terminally ill AIDS patients in clinical trials show virtually no sign of 

HIV infection.

*   TNP treated patients display virtually no side effects to treatment.

*   TNP technology is patented in 16 countries and patent pending in 

Canada and the U.S.

*   Treatments are far less costly and less cumbersome than currently 

employed alternatives.

I kept checking but I don't think I spilled anything (even though I had angel hair pasta with marinara sauce).
The situation from where I sit is fairly uncertain - as I understand it Corp has rejected our proposal and we are not sure under what authority or funding we are operating.  The preliminary list of names is as follows.  This list changes each day and includes both current employees and onew we need to get back.



A good number of these will be leaving today and not returning until I can give them some certainty on coninued employment and a retention plan.  If that happens, value lost to Corp. will be significant.

FROM:   Louise Marshall (lmarshall@isda.org); Katia D'Hulster

(kdhulster@isda-eur.org)



DATE:       December 4, 2001



RE:     Credit Derivatives Documentation; Review of 1999 Definitions





Three Supplements and Commentaries have been published on ISDA's website

relating to amendments to the 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions (the

Definitions).  These three Supplements to the Definitions are: (i) the

Restructuring Supplement published on May 11, 2001; (ii) the Supplement

Relating to Convertible, Exchangeable or Accreting Obligations, published on

November 9, 2001; and (iii) the Supplement on Successor and Credit Events,

published on November 28, 2001.  As indicated at the Credit Derivatives

Market Practice Committee meeting on November 5 in London and New York, ISDA

will publish a Supplement that rolls all three Supplements into one, for

ease of reference.  We will also do the same for the Commentaries. 



ISDA has received member feedback that it would be useful to update the

Definitions in 2002.  Accordingly, taking into account that the three

Supplements have already been published, we would like to receive any

additional comments that you might have on other areas of the Definitions.

Please direct your comments to Kimberly Summe at ksumme@isda.org by Friday,

January 18.  Once comments are received and reviewed, we will hold another

Credit Derivatives Market Practice Committee meeting, probably in February

2002. Details will be sent out in January 2002.



Also, as a reminder, final comments are due on the User's Guide (also to

ksumme@isda.org) by Monday, January 7, 2002.  



Thank you in advance for your consideration.
Have comments on presentation, but cannot find you.
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.



We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  



We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  



Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  



As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 



For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.
Updated questions and answers for Enron employees have just been posted to http://home.enron.com/updates/qa.html  

We recognize that as active employees you have special concerns and questions related to Enron's bankruptcy filing.  We regret that we are not able to answer all of your questions as quickly as you deserve, but we are working to provide accurate responses to your most important questions about employee benefits, expense payments and so on.  We appreciate your patience as we continue to try to provide timely and reliable information to you.

Here's the scoop as I know it as of 3;15 today.



2002 Commercial Plan mtg for McCarty, Thursday, August 16th

As of 8/14 @ 2:40, Danny advised that the meeting will proceed BUT, suggested that they break at 10:00 and attend the Enron All -Employee meeting and reconvene at 11:00 - 1:00. Note the lunch will be delivered at 11:30.

Tracy & John, can you arrange the Agenda accordingly and reminder that Eric Gadd will be leaving at 12:00 so his area should be covered before then.  Can we achieve the business goals with the break?  Is this ambitious?

If you want to extend the meeting time, I have extended the conference room (49C2) till 1:30.  The conference room is booked at 2:00 by Steve Harris/Drew Fossum but, I could ask them to adjust their meeting if more time is needed. Please advise.



Quarter Forecast Review w/ Stan, Wednesday, August 22nd 

CANCELED as per Tracy on 8/13



NNG/TW Actuals alias CBR meeting, Friday, September 14th at 1:30

A request from Deb/Dave's office to reschedule as Dave had conflict and can not attend. I followed up with Cindy on July 26th & 27th and Cindy suggested that Danny talk to Stan.  I reminded Danny to discuss with Stan at the July 30th staff meeting.  No discussion or resolution.

Note that a CBR update was completed on July 11th and as per Tracy, the information would be fairly current to update Stan.  A NB Strategy meeting was also completed on July 19th in Omaha.

8/14, as per Tracy, Stan referred back to Danny.  Danny suggested canceling and thought we had already done so.  I advised him that the Quarter Forecast Review w/ Stan was canceled but, not this particular meeting. CANCEL??  



3rd CE Review w/ Stan, Tuesday, September 18th

Confirmed on Danny's calendar

Some brief comments:



1.b)  Term:   Finance would greatly prefer a right to extend for a period of at least 10 years to be exercised at least 2 years prior to the expiration date.   This would allow for time to find a replacement shipper before the expiration date.   In no case should we agree to an annual evergreen as this is optionality without any cost to them. 

2.      Conduct of Open season/Contract Quantity Reduction:   Need to establish an Initial Recourse Rate prior to the open season in order for their proposed mechanism to work.  Without it there is no way to measure the proportionate reduction requested. 



We need to get Paul Cherry working on the credit of MGI Supply ASAP.

Tracy,



Just give me a time.
Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.



 

Electric Business Understanding - November 27

The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 

 

Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14

This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.



Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19

This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.



Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20

This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.  

 



For enrollment, or more information on these courses, please log on to http://elm.enron.com.
Attached is the Certificate Status Report (Omaha)  for November 2001.
Please find attached files. Call me with any questions you may have.
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.



We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.



The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.



This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.



I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.



Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).



Thank you.
No problem. I love you too. Let me know what time you are leaving today. If you wanted, we could ride together and leave your car (or mine) here. Or, if it's easier, we can just leave according to our own schedule. I thought I would leave by about 5pm.
Please remember to send Jan the Wessex 2002 Plan.

Tracy,

Peggy's flight is scheduled to arrive at 12:06 and depart at 6:55.



So depending on how traffic is, it seems like you could schedule her at

2:30-3:00.  Which would give her enough time to get to the meeting and

enough time to catch the plane given rush hour traffic and the increased

check in time at the airport.



Let Mary and I know if this works for you.

until he returns on Wednesday and do it at 9:00 or 9:30 Wednesday.



Or the two of us can talk on Monday and address the team on Wednesday.

Thanks. You're the bomb!
Fair Value is applied to plant and is being amortized over a useful life. 

TW Fair Value is very similar to Goodwill in that it represents an excess over book value, and is not formally being recoverd in rates; BUT at the time of the  acquistion it was treated as a purchase price allocation an applied to plant. Goodwill is meant to be a leftover after all costs have been allocated.
See comment below.
Tracy:



Sorry to bother you with this one again -



in 1999 and 2000, what were the revenues and costs associated with the base gas sales - the footnote disclosure indicates $53 million and $34 million in sales but not the cost.  In addition, going forward, how much of the 2001 and 2002 TG&S expense is solely related to this transaction (i.e. expenses that would not be incurred but for this transaction)? My question may be a bit confusing - call me if I am totally off base!
Does TPC or NNG have any investments in any non-pipeline assets (financial or otherwise)?  I was not aware of any but we need to disclose these.
both have investments in financial instruments; but they are in support of the base pipeline business

both have a huge stake in enron via ene notes!!
Per your request, view the attached file for the answers to the questions you ask. Please call should you have any other questions relate to either of these transactions.
Please see attached file.
The last slide I'm working on is the Detail of Market Value slide.  I have a draft completed, but Steve has not been able to review it.  As long as I can get time with him in the morning and the changes aren't significant I should be able to have the presentation to you.
I would ask for a few things:



    First - I would like to see the relationship between the 3 factors they have chosen and the costs of the support system, i.e. a justification of the 3 factors.

    Second - I would like to know why we have chosen to change the methodology agreed to in the beginning.     For those of you who are users, this methodology will drive to   charge you with reducing your number of users, and to reduce the factors.    This is why we didn't go this way to begin with.

    Third - I would like to see the detail for the last 12 months on the 3 factors chosen by company.
Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

Attached is the final budget presentation.  The only page that changed significantly is the last page dealing with ABA.  The numbers themselves did not change, only how we presented the downside case.
I have attached a summary and schedules which indicate the following.



EPPI owes Oneok/GPM $339,158.69

Oneok owes NNG  $  92,774.99

Net amount due is   $246,383.70  Per Dan Fancler



Oneok invoices total $301,383.96.  Oneok has not recognized that some months they paid under the 4.45% and owe NNG.

 Oneok is pushing hard for the money, so I am turning over the resolution of the differences to NNG marketing and the resolution of the cash payment to Tracy Geaccone and/or Jennifer Lev.

Therefore, Enron would like to remind you that the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is available to provide you and your dependents with confidential access to a professional who can offer support and direction with personal or job-related issues.

Please see Debra Thompson's note below regarding not setting up FAR orders for floor space billing. I also received a message from Billie Akhave stating EPSC will not be billing to FAR orders -- only company/cost centers.



The last information I had was that all pipeline company employees' space should be billed to FAR orders. Has this changed?

Tracy and James,



Elaine and Phil thought it would be nice to include this summary page in the plan review package for Stan's review next week.



 

I think Rod mentioned that Stan has set a target for Phil of 5.0MM for 2002.  Please advise if this is still valid because Phil personally has not heard that from Stan.  The numbers that we have in Adaytum match the $4.4 MM net contribution.  The remaining $0.6MM are salary offsets on NNG.  42P does not have employees and they use NNG employees.  When they do that, NNg charges the salaries of the employees for the applicable # of hours to 42P.  Therefore,  42P covers expenses that NNG would have to bear otherwise.  Phil feels that the $0.6MM of salaries offsets should be counted toward the 5.0 target since it's a benefit that 42P brings to NNG.  James and I talked about this on the phone.



Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Attached is the revised 4th Qtr Forecast Summary.



Also, attached is the expense analysis I did.  Please note, I did not include UAF.



I have compared our actual numbers with James' spreadsheet and Steve Kleb's earnings model.  Once I made that adjustment for the $244 reserve in August on James' spreadsheet, we are all in agreement that the YTD actuals for TW commercial is $162.7.  I have also verified that number with Robert Miller and he agrees that is the number reflected on the Income Statement.



The $244 reserve reversal was made in September and reflected in the transport margins revenues.

Based upon my review of the files and discussions with other lawyers and other business people:



Ameritex Ventures II, Ltd.-  No further funding commitment exists.

Nutech Energy Alliance, Ltd. - A DASH has been approved for funding $2,627,000 million.  $592,000 has been funded.  There is no known legal documentation of a commitment to fund any additional amount.  It is unclear what expectations other partners may have regarding future fundings by the Enron entity.

Texland Limited Partnership -  An AFE for $4 million has been approved but funding will not be required until next year.  Approximately $1 million/month for the first four months of 2002 will most likely be required.

Andex Credit Facility - Fundings are in the sole discretion of ECTMI as the agent.

Tri-C Resources - ENA is committed to fund $30,000-40,000 of general and administrative expenses this year.

Westwin Energy I Limited Partnership - Additional capital contributions require unanimous consent of the partners.  A Dash has been approved for $7,400,000 contingent upon certain levels of success and an engineer's report.

Hanson - No further funding obligations exists.

Due to the recent developments at Enron, the ENhance luncheon scheduled for next week will be postponed until further notice.  Although this luncheon has been postponed, Enron recognizes the value and importance of the administrative assistant community, and will reschedule the launch of the ENhance program as soon as possible.  



ENhance Committee would like to thank all those that participated in the development of this important program. 



#sig##comp#The ENhance Committee
Shortly before the teleconference Board meeting two weeks ago we received an

application from the Bank of England for subscriber membership. When we have

considered central banks or government agencies for membership in the past,

consideration has focused on the nature of the applicant's derivatives

activities, its regulatory role and the type of information they are likely

to obtain from ISDA. Because of their derivatives activities, we have

generally admitted these applicants (e.g., the Kingdoms of Belgium, Denmark

and Sweden, the Reserve Banks of South Africa and New Zealand). We have even

admitted the Bank for International Settlements as a member. In general, we

let them know that they may not be able to receive the full range of ISDA

materials (e.g., draft comment letters or position papers) and that there

may be a need to exclude them from certain committees or discussions.

 

In previous Board discussions, a higher degree of concern has been expressed

if, theoretically, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of

England or similarly influential central banks were to apply for membership.

These central banks typically have a greater degree of involvement in the

regulatory debates (particularly on capital) and are better positioned to

influence the process.

 

Since some of those previous debates, the regulatory role of the Bank of

England has diminished and the role of the Financial Services Authority has

correspondingly increased. The Bank of England still plays the traditional

central bank roles of controller of the money supply, dealing in the market

and lender of last resort, but the supervisory role has shifted to the FSA. 

 

In light of these developments, but recognizing the concerns previously

expressed on central bank membership, I would appreciate your views on the

application of the Bank of England. We have also had overtures from the Hong

Kong Monetary Authority regarding membership although we have not received

an application.

 

Please share your views with the other members of the Board.

Many thanks for your assistance yesterday. Clinton Energy Management Services, Inc. because it holds a current power marketing certificate is an entity which we would like to move to being a direct subsidiary of Enron Corp. to take effect today. This is considered to be an essential part of restructuring to meet our current and future needs. 

    

While the day to day control will remain where it is and all the efforts assign contracts and other work should progress as planned, since the value to Enron Corp. is the power marketing certificate nothing should be done to jeopardize this. In addition we will be changing the charter and will need copies of the existing charter to effect those changes required.

    

Please call me if you need to discuss this further.

Management Committee Members:



In light of today's meeting being canceled, we would like for you to give consideration to Jeff Huff as a candidate for Commercial Support VP.  Jeff has interviewed with Mark Frevert, Ray Bowen and Steve Kean who have given favorable feedback.  At this time, we would like to proceed with an offer.  Please contact us with any concerns or questions by the close of business Thursday.  If we have no opposing votes, we will proceed.



Below are a few points and a resume for your review:



Resume: Currently the second most productive Partner at Diamond-Cluster, a technology consulting firm. He has been working at Enron for the last 2+ years, first for Tom Gros in EBS and Net Works and then for Dan Reck in Freight, developing trading systems. 

The Job: We are looking to bring Jeff in as VP, Commercial Support.  The demands of growing the group require a consistent focus on technology, expenses, front and back office productivity, as well as constant re-analysis of growth strategies. 

Justification: Jeff's capabilities in these areas make him extremely qualified. We rely on him heavily already, but at consulting rates he costs us more than $1.3mm per year and his focus is limited to technology. Most importantly, the lead commercial folks in the group are overburdened with administrative issues and spending too little time bringing in earnings.

Mark, Rob



My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.



Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: 



1. Continuing to trade



The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. 



The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.  



I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. 





2. Filing accounts



The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. 



I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? 



We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? 





That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4.

As you may be aware, I am conducting an in-house seminar on compliance with labor and employment laws and the practice of good employee relations.  This 4 hour, interactive program is tailored to Enron's culture and ETS-specific issues.  Stan Horton and the ETS Division Heads have mandated attendance for all Managers and above, and for those persons who have supervisory responsibility.



    The main goals of this session are to help management avoid employment-related litigation, maintain a trouble-free workplace, and maximize employee productivity.  In order to accomplish these goals, it is imperative to understand the intricate connection between sound management practices and legal requirements.



    Some of the topics covered are: maintaining a discrimination and harassment free workplace; the hiring process; compensation issues; performance management; lawful terminations; and all related topics that are necessary to effectively control the risks associated with managing a workforce.



    There are three sessions open in October -- the 3rd, 17th, and 31st.  They run from 8:00 to Noon.  Please 

contact my assistant, Miranda Southard, by e-mail to enroll in one of these sessions.  She will then provide you the exact location and other particulars.



    Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

I am copying to you my note of last night to Mark and Rob. 



Email correspondence has been exchanged concerning support letters for EES companies in the UK, but the issue impacts all UK companies and also (given minor differences in legal regimes) those in all other European jurisdictions. 



Hopefully the conclusion now is that Corp feels able to give the standard support letters, and the additional comfort referred to in my note below. The consequences of Corp not being able to are fairly dire.

As stated on the revised 2002 Plan Key Dates calendar, Friday, September 7 was the day preliminary allocations were due to any business unit which will be recieving allocations from your business unit.  If you have not yet communicated the amounts with the BUs who will be a receiver of costs from your BU, this is a freindly suggestion that you may want to at least touch base with the receiver BUs.  Since targets are to scheduled to be communicated this week and some groups have already begun to build their Plan, it is important that some additional unexpected allocated costs aren't a surprise at the last minute.  Some business units may interpret not hearing anything from another business unit as no allocations are forthcoming.  This week is important to the overall planning process, since questions and clarifications regarding allocations should be taking place this in order to facilitate the allocations being finalized by the 14th (the end of this week).

FROM:           Pedro D. Martinez



DATE:           October 2, 2001



RE:         Next Brazilian Subcommittee Meeting





Dear All,



Based on your responses our Next Brazilian Subcommittee Meeting will be held

on Thursday, October 4, 2001 at 11:00 am New York time at ISDA. As usual, we

will provide a call in number for people that are traveling or located

abroad.



ISDA is considering a visit to Brazil of several days in order to hold

meetings with the Central Bank as well as other regulators - NMC, e.g.,

market players, netting legislation contacts, lawyers working on master

agreement development, and others in order to further the agenda of the

Brazilian Subcommittee and to be able to prepare for the conference planned

for Brazil next year.



In preparation for our subcommittee meeting ISDA would like to obtain from

your institution by Thursday a list (Wish List) of local OTC derivatives

market issues for ISDA to address as well as suggestions for meetings and

organizations with which ISDA might meet to address these issues. This Wish

List will be of enormous help to ISDA for purposes of having an adequate

and focused agenda for planning visits with a number of Brazilian

institutions and authorities. 



Please reply R.S.V.P. by email to Scott Marra (smarra@isda.org) if you would

like to attend.



If you have additional suggestions in terms of the topics to be included in

our agenda please do not hesitate to contact me.

Alan, where is the special narrative of my EEL board membership.  Should I resign from all of these companies immediately?

We have heard from many of you regarding the attached request.  This e-mail lets you know suggested recipients to date.  It also confirms that (i) the current goal is to ascertain whether a change of ownership of either Enron Corp. or Enron North America Corp. will cause contract breaches, defaults or terminations resulting in material liabilities and (ii) the timetable is as soon as possible.  Preliminary responses early this week (subject to further review as necessary) would be most helpful.



#sig##name#Thanks again, NJD
For Enron Canada Corp. and Enron Canada Power Corp., the following is a summary of change in control provisions:



1.  Current Precedent Form of Master Firm Physical Gas Agreement - there is no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked)

2.  Current Precedent Form of Guarantee supporting the Gas Master - no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked)

3.  Current Precedent Form of Master Firm Physical Power Agreement - although there is no change in control provision, there is an Event of Default where a party reorganizes (including by asset transfer) into another entity and, at the time of such reorganization, the resulting entity fails to assume all the obligations of the predecessor party under that agreement (individual contracts would ahve to be checked)

4.  Current Precedent Form of Guarantee supporting the Power Master - no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked)

5.  Physical GTCs (Gas and Power) - no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked)

6.  ISDA - there is an Event of Default where one party reorganizes (including by asset transfer) and the resulting entity does not assume the obligations of the preceding entity under the ISDA.  There is also a Credit Event upon Merger when one party or its Credit Support Provider reorganizes and the creditworthiness of the resulting entity is materially weaker than the predecessor entity.  A Credit Event upon Merger allows the non-affected party to terminate. (individual contracts would ahve to be checked)

7.  Financial Omnibus - in the financial terms and conditions (Annex A) there is an Event of Default where a party reorganizes (including by asset transfer) into another entity and, at the time of such reorganization, either the resulting entity fails to assume all of the obligations of the Defaulting Party under the Confirmation or  the resulting entity's creditworthiness is materially weaker than that of the Defaulting Party (mirroring the ISDA Merger without Assumption and Credit Event upon Merger). (individual contracts would ahve to be checked)

8.  Impact Energy Subscription Agreement - no change in control provisions

9.  Petro Canada Services Agreement - Section 11.4 indicates that Enron Canada ceasing to be an affiliate of Enron North America Corp. is a material breach of the agreement entitling PC to terminate the agreement in accordance with its terms.

10.  Suncor Services Agreement - Article 18 allows for the termination of the agreement by Suncor if (i) there is a change in shareholding of either ECC or ENA that results in either or both ceasing to be an affiliate of Enron Corp. or (ii) ECC or ENA disposes of all or substantially all of its or their assets or (iii) ECC, ENA or Enron Corp. amalgamate, merge or consolidate into another entity other than an affiliate and such transaction would have a material adverse impact on the business on Suncor.

11.  Sundance B Power Purchase Arangement - no change in control provision

12.  British Energy Power Purchase Agreement - no change in control provision

13.  OEFC Services Agreement - no change in control provision 

14.  ENERconnect Services Agreement - no change in control provision 

15.  SYNCRUDE Services Agreement - no change in control provision

16.  CASCO Services Agreement - no change in control provision

17.  Papier Masson Agreements - these were all transferred to Houston and should be checked by someone in EIM



As far as trading agreements go, I believe that most if not all inter-company contracts (ie. between ECC and Enron Direct, ENA, EES, etc.) have a MAC clause relating to ownership by Enron Corp. but I am not aware of any third party trading agreements that would contain the same provision with respect to Enron Canada.

Performance-Based Ratemaking Conference



December 5-7, 2001, Denver, CO



OVERVIEW



 



Performance Based Ratemaking (PBR) is emerging as a key element of the restructuring of the electric utility industry. For PBR to be effective it must be designed carefully and uniquely for each utility so as to align the interests of the utility, the shareholders and the customers and also to make sure that PBR is successful in achieving efficiency and service quality.



 



EUCI has put together a covey of expert speakers to review and address the latest PBR developments and applications.  Join us in Denver and get the latest state-of-the-art information and insights you will need to develop an effective PBR strategy for your company.

Electric Power Market Performance Conference



December 12-14, 2001, Denver, CO



OVERVIEW



 



Each year there is additional opportunity to draw lessons regarding electricity market structure and design from actual market performance. These lessons are leading to a convergence in market design, at least in the Eastern Interconnection and ERCOT. One focus of this conference will be on the lessons to be drawn from the experience of the new ERCOT markets, the continuing market design problems in California, and the difficulties in developing and implementing a market based congestion management system in the midwest.



 



A second focus of this conference will be on the existing markets in PJM and New York, which have now moved beyond managing their internal markets and are being pushed by market participants and regulatory agencies to better address inter-RTO coordination and develop market based incentive systems for transmission expansion.



 



Finally, the conference will highlight one of the important, but little noticed successes of the Eastern ISOs, which is the explosive growth in the PJM and New York financial rights auctions.

Transmission Expansion and Systems in Transition Conference



Feb. 6-7, 2002, Miami, Florida



OVERVIEW



This conference will examine the business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO initiatives.  The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system.

We are close to making a decision on whether to use F&J or some other firm for a new Mariner matter.  I anticipate that if we retain some other firm besides F&J, F&J may want to give us our files back, per the original Gus Blackshear letter to Jim.  Of course, F&J will insist in giving back one of Mark's files under any circumstance.  Put aside for a moment the problematic ethical issue that I believe that raises for F&J and whether we would pursue F&J for taking such an action. If F&J sends our files back, can we live with that in the cases/matters you are handling?  



    For Mark, Jordan and Theresa, I of course already have Theresa's voice-mail regarding the new Mariner matter, and have (along with Jim) spoken with Scott Josie.  I also have an urgent call in for Kelly Zelacovitz.



    If there is anyone else you think I should include in this e-mail, please let me know.



    Please reply ASAP.

Mark,



I'd be grateful if we could have a short conversation today at a convenient time to suit you to discuss:



1. The West LB LC facility. Corp still has not formed a view on whether we can give the no material litigation rep. so we cannot revert to West LB. Apart from the ?55m potentially available from WLB, Enron Europe now have NO LC facilities available. This is hurting us. Even if the answer is negative, at least we could give WLB a clear answer and negotiate to draw down on the facility.



2. Wrongful trading comfort. The directors having taken independent advice and been told that some fairly low level comfort is needed from Houston, noise and nervousness is now growing at this end because it has not been forthcoming. I attach a draft which would suffice.



 

Can we please talk about how we can get Jeff McMahon to send this to Michael Brown.



3.ICI Counterindemnities and TXU: I discussed these with Jeff Hodge yesterday. Do you need anything more from me on these?   



#sig#Thanks

Dawn,

    In the files you have sent for the 2002 Corp. Costs you have a column for ETS HQ.  It appears that there are several companies' allocations in that one column.  We will need to see the Co. 366 costs broken out from these other companies.  For example, if you have included costs for Co. 1202 and Co. 1195, these need to be separated out in detail.  Both Co. 1202 and Co. 1195 have employees.  Co. 366 allocates their costs and we will not know the dollars that belong to these other companies without a breakout in your spreadsheet.  Thank you for your assistance.  Should you have any questions please call.

My first thoughts are to review the Solar Noncompetition Agreement (noncompete regarding the manufacture of photovoltaic cells in connection with the sale of Enron's 50% interest in the Amoco/Enron Solar Partnership to BP Amoco), the NewPower Noncompetition Agreement and the ServiceCo Noncompetition Agreement (EES new facility services venture).  My recollection is that the NewPower Noncompete and the ServiceCo Noncompete allow defeasance of the noncompetition provisions by permitting the investors to have put rights at fair market value (in other words, the noncompete provisions will bind a successor unless the investor honors the put rights).  It has been some time since I reviewed the Solar Noncompete, but I believe it could bind a successor if a third party merged or consolidated with Enron Corp., as opposed to a stock or asset purchase.  I also need to check the expiry date of this agreement, as it may be close to expiration.

I have reconciled the detail file on these and no other ETS company is picking up the costs.  I will be sending a detailed list of the companies to receive restricted stock with the final allocations on Wednesday.

CUIABA  (not typically associated with good news)

2.  Consent signed:  Both Furnas and Electrobras (the guarantor) have now signed the consent, and aditivo #5 whereby Furnas will take on the risk associated with new regulatory issues and pass those costs through to end users.  ANEEL has approved but still must formally ratify this plan.  Thus, we are getting closer to financial close by year end.  The issues of political force majeure and the survival of the Electrobras guaranty are still under negotiation with the Brazilian government. It is unclear at this time how the recent turn of events at Enron will impact the financing. 



3.  Shell:  The mediation was temporarily suspended a day early.  The parties will consider Shell swapping its interest in Cuiaba for Enron assets GTB, TBG and Transredes.    The parties are determining whether this swap makes sense and, depending on the outcome,  will reconvene either to negotiate the swap or continue the mediation.  This dispute must be settled to close financing.



4.  Insurance:  Reservation of rights letter to be issued as a result of Siemens report that the row 3 cracks first appeared in 1999, but Siemens advised the Owner they were normal and thus the plant should continue to run. We are covered for our own negligence but still no final word on coverage.  All information requested by underwriters has been provided, including Siemens' correspondence advising the Owner that the cracks were not material.

All:  I understand that Mirant, the buyer in our EcoElectrica deal, may have some outstanding trading exposure with Enron and/or its affiliates.  The issue has been raised of whether Mirant may attempt to offset amounts to which Mirant believes it is entitled against the $266 million purchase price that Mirant is obligated to pay an Enron affiliate in the EcoElectrica deal.  I understand that Enron has netting agreements in place with certain counterparties which may permit such offsets.  Which lawyer in the Enron trading world can help me determine what, if any, contractual arrangements are in place with Mirant that bear on this important issue?  Pls let me know.

ISDA Publishes Credit Publishes Credit Derivatives Convertibles Supplement

ISDA Press Release - November 9, 2001

<http://www.isda.org/whatsnew/index.html>



NEW YORK, Friday, November 9, 2001 - The International Swaps and Derivatives

Association announced today that it has finalized and published the

Supplement Relating to Convertible, Exchangeable or Accreting Obligations.

The Supplement and Commentary can be accessed under the What's New section

of the ISDA's web site. 



The Convertibles Supplement addresses the treatment under the 1999 ISDA

Credit Derivatives Definition of certain types of convertible and

exchangeable obligations, as well as the treatment of accreting obligations,

such as zero-coupon bonds, low coupon bonds issued at a discount and

non-discounted bonds that accrete during their term.  The Convertibles

Supplement represents the consensus of a diverse range of constituents in

the credit derivatives markets, including portfolio managers, credit

protection sellers and dealers, said Robert G. Pickel, Executive Director

and CEO of ISDA.





ISDA Debuts Credit Derivatives Number at $631.5 billion in OTC Market Survey

ISDA Press Release - November 9, 2001

<http://www.isda.org/whatsnew/index.html>



NEW YORK, Friday, November 9, 2001 - The International Swaps and Derivatives

Association (ISDA) announced today that the global notional outstanding

volume of credit derivatives transactions was $631.497 billion for the first

half of 2001. While still modest in relation to interest rate products, this

figure is expected to remain on a strong upward trend compared to more

mature derivative product areas.



Polling member firms for the first time on credit derivatives transactions,

ISDA surveyed total notional outstanding volumes for single name credit

default swaps, default swaps on baskets of up to ten credits, and portfolio

transactions of ten credits and more. 83 ISDA member firms supplied data on

these products. Interest rate and currency derivatives growth was 3.573% in

the first half of the year among members that also reported to ISDA at

year-end 2000. For these firms, total notional outstanding volumes increased

from $53.267 trillion to $55.170 trillion. Total notional principle of

interest rate swaps, interest rate options and currency swaps for all

surveyed firms dipped to $57.305 trillion from $63.009 trillion last year.

Among top ten dealers, there was also a minor decrease in volume from

$35.648 trillion to $35.532 trillion.



Shifting product use is a reflection of a more uncertain global market

environment, said Thomas K. Montag, Vice-Chairman of ISDA and Chair of the

Association's Market Survey Committee. The market for credit protection has

an obvious appeal during times of economic downturn, said Mr Montag, a

Managing Director of Global Interest Rate Products and Asia FICC, and

Co-President of Goldman Sachs (Japan), Ltd.



The survey, which is compiled twice yearly by Andersen LLP, is performed on

a confidential basis. It is complemented by the more comprehensive survey

produced quarterly by the Bank for International Settlements. Of the 83

member institutions providing outstanding notional volumes figures in the

ISDA interest rate and currency derivatives survey, 67 were participants in

the previous semi-annual survey.

Supranational Studies First Use Of Credit Derivatives 

Derivatives Week - November 12, 2001



The European Investment Bank, a multinational lender with a EUR215 billion

(USD192 billion) loan portfolio, is considering using credit derivatives for

the first time as a means of hedging its credit risks next year. Officials

at the EIB in Luxembourg said the lender is currently conducting an internal

review on the credit derivatives market and is weighing whether it makes

sense to use products such as single-name default swaps to mitigate risk.

Credit [derivatives] would be a completely new field for us, said Luis

Pacheco, an official in the credit-risk department in Luxembourg, noting the

bank has used foreign exchange swaps in the past on the back of its bond

offerings but has not used any derivatives on its loan portfolio. 



The lender hands out EUR36 billion per year, EUR30 billion of which is

within the European Union, to highly rated banks and corporates. Two-thirds

of the loans go to highly-rated banks with credit ratings in the A range

with maturities of 15-25 years, which then loan money to small and

medium-sized enterprises. The remaining third goes to corporates across the

credit spectrum in five to 15-year tenors. 



Pacheco said the EIB will accept default swaps in place of bank guarantees,

which it now requires as a means of hedging risk on the bulk of its

long-term lending, if the market is deemed liquid enough. Officials were

unable to quantify potential usage of credit derivatives given the early

stage of the discussions. 



Credit derivatives pros were excited to hear of the EIB's discussions. It's

just a matter of time until the credit derivatives market becomes more like

the interest-rate swaps market and what we're seeing now is the initial

phase, said one trader, adding, I'm not surprised. 



Pacheco and other EIB officials said the reason behind the review is because

the default swap market is more liquid and as a result may offer more

attractive pricing for debtors. The advantage is the portfolio approach,

commented one official. The EIB has considered using credit derivatives in

the past, although it found the market was not developed enough and so we

were not interested, said Pacheco. The supranational is analyzing the

market now to see if that has changed in terms of liquidity and critical

mass in the last year as is expected. Now we want to see the new situation

of the market and to see if we can use it in our business, he said. He

declined comment on potential counterparties. 





Basle study suggests changes to the Accord

IFR - November 10, 2001



Banks could face higher capital charges under Basle II's internal ratings

based (IRB) foundation approach to credit risk reserving than its more

advanced, standardised approach.



Contrary to the Baste Committee on Banking Supervision's desired results,

the IRB foundation approach's minimum capital requirements would be 14%

higher among large G-1O banks, the regulators' quantitative impact study

(QIS) found.



Under the standardised approach, these banks would see their requirements

increase 6% on average. An average change of - 5% was reached when banks

were asked to calibrate credit risk using the IRB advanced approach laid out

in the Committee's January proposal, according to the QIS released last

week.



To address the fact that the approach slated as the less intensive yielded

higher charges, and to understand better the impact that the January

proposal would have on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the

Committee is conducting a follow-on impact study.



The January proposal's corporate and retail risk weight curves and its

method for recognition of physical collateral and receivables may be

modified as a result of this study, the regulator said last week. The

January draft was not balanced because it was biased towards the views of

large banks engaged in large corporate lending activities, noted one

industry official.



The corporate risk weight curve under the new QIS is likely to reduce the

capital requirements for many SME borrowers relative to the January

proposal, the Committee said. Additional work is also under way aimed at

assessing the probable impact of applying separate risk weight curves for

residential mortgage exposures and for other retail exposures. Under the

Committee's January proposal, the IRB approach treated all retail exposures

using the same risk weight curve.



The impact of assuming a 45% loss-given default (LGD) for loans fully

secured by non-property physical collateral and a 40% LCD for loans fully

secured by receivables will be examined in the new QIS.  Under the January

proposal banks with the foundation approach have no incentive to use most

forms of collateral, said Marc Intrater, managing director at Oliver, Wyman

in New York.



Other than commercial and residential property collateral, the January

proposal did not recognise physical collateral or trade receivables as

collateral. As such, loans fully secured by either received a 50% LGD. Banks

that use collateral for their secured lending and do it well generally

experience a reduction in credit risk. The Committee's decision to undertake

a follow-up impact exercise is widely viewed as revisionist, say market

participants. Similar moves earlier this year appear poised to result in

changes to the January proposal, they note.



There is a lot of waiting until the final accord. But most banks realise

that even though the accord does not come into effect until 2005, getting

ready for it requires a lot of lead time, said Intrater. The Baste

Committee plans to release a final version of its proposed accord in

February.

Joe -



Thanks for the information.  As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke.  As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the sponsor of any of them.



Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects.  Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action.  I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call.  Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I approve these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a placeholder for the budget.  I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these approvals if the budget has been approved.



If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so.  Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the extranet project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn.  Once we (Ed and I) have reviewed the feasibility study proposed by Cornelio, we will determine the next steps to be taken and whether or not this project should move forward.  I will advise you accordingly.

I recalculated combined throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for the West & East markets.



I used the throughput for West & East markets vs. contracted capacity (1090 West; 660 East, total 1750).

Below is what I came up with.



Qestion 3:  84% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD.

Hello Tracy,



I wanted to share some conversations that I've had with both Demetrics and

Hoang this week related to the project.



On of the biggest issue seems to be with resources.  I know that you guys

have been quite busy with your planning process but it has been very

difficult to get the required information or time from the resources that

are committed to the project.  This is due to the fact that they currently

have a heavy workload and cannot dedicate the time necessary for the

project.  It is having an impact on the timeline.  The home office model

could be a lot further along if some of the required information was

delivered as requested.  Also, I am also getting a sense that there is a

lack of ownership with regards to the Adaytum application.  It is important

that the users have a comfort level with the application otherwise it will

become very difficult to transition it when the project is over.



We need to think about who will administer the system once it is in full

production.  This individual should be identified and running the

administration duties as soon as possible.  My fear is that without proper

ownership of the application and a dedicated administrator (at least in the

short run), it will be very difficult to transition the roles.



We've had some technical issues with the production and development

environment.  Although these issues have been resolved, it has had an impact

on the timeline.



There are times that the definition for the model is not clearly articulated

and it has resulted in the redesign of the model.  Much time has been spent

on gathering business process information from various people which has

caused a delay in the model development.



I hope that we can constructively talk through these issues tomorrow and

produce solutions that will rectify the situation, mitigate the risks, and

result in a successful implementation.





Our call is scheduled for 1:30 tomorrow but I can be available earlier if

you would like to discuss this.

** END OF ORDER **
Tracy,



Over the past few months, Rositza has been researching where the rebates related to Operations have been booked because Phil had earmarked them specifically to assist us in achieving our stretch target.  The rebates are not hitting Operations cost centers, and for numerous reasons from Accounting, they cannot be reclassified into the Operations hierarchies.  Since the rebates received are outside of Operations and Phil should get credit for them, I am reducing our stretch for the upcoming forecast for the rebates actually recorded through September and those expected for Q4.  This is a total of $1.0MM.  If you need documentation, I can forward Rositza's research to you.  Let me know if you have questions.



The ETS forecast we will submit for Operations will only include what will show up in that column for actuals at year end.  It includes our IBIT estimate for co.'s 1202, 184, 42P, 1195.  Any other amounts we have carried there in previous forecasts will be moved to the pipeline where we expect to see the actuals.  This forecast should represent our best estimate of where we will actually end up for the year (as of today!).  We continue to monitor spending closely, and will adjust next month if necessary.
